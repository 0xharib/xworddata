953,Meat in the oven is only half cooked (7),VENISON,"found in oVEN IS ONly – definition is ‘meat’. I can’t make much sense of ‘half cooked’, there is no anagram and it does not use only half the letters. ‘The’ also seems redundant, though this could be overlooked as some padding to make the clue read better. Possibly the original idea was an anagram of OVEN IS ON (half of only)?"

The answer is that anagram indicators have been part of cryptic crosswords for over 80 years and by now setters are running out of ways to indicate an anagram that solvers have not seen 100s of times before. Hence there is an informal understanding that definitions of anagram indicators do not need to be as tight as other definitions in the puzzle. Anything that hints at rearrangement, however obliquely, will do. In this case I think “applying” indicates “using these letters you can get…”."
