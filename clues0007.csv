"
1,"A crooner, fellow from an Oxfordshire town",ABINGDON,"A + BING + DON
"
2,Irritable old servants,LIVERY,"ddThis is one of the clues I struggled with, mainly because the word I’d use would be liverish. Perfectly fair though.
"
3,Awfully foul brew could make one flounce,FURBELOW,"anagram of FOUL BREW;
"
4,"Precise, short, theatre cleaner",SURGICAL SPIRIT,"Nice clue, with two definitions: of  ‘precise’, and ‘short’ in the alcoholic sense.

"

"
7,"A bye, perhaps, in over",EXTRA,dd
8,Accept compassion is to be encouraged,TAKE HEART,
9,"Two pianists, drunk",BRAHMS AND LISZT,"Which of course is Cockney rhyming slang for a word I couldn’t possibly elucidate for an audience as genteel as fifteensquared. Oh, all right then, it’s ‘pissed’.
"
10,Free wood used to make a stall,LOOSEBOX,"LOOSE + BOX
"
11,Guide by hand,MANUAL,dd
12,Anxiety shown by South American writers at closing of bookstore,SUSPENSE,"S + US + PENS + E

21,Class points out what a theatre may put on,VARIETY SHOWS,"Charade of VARIETY (class) and SHOWS (points out)
"
22,Running on tenth lap in old Olympic event,PENTATHLON,"anagram of ON TENTH LAP; I think Everyman has inserted ‘old’ because the competition we have nowadays is called the ‘modern pentathlon’.
"
23,Hitchcock film noir – too darned American,NOTORIOUS,"anagram of NOIR TOO; + US
"
24,A grant secured by the sportsman,ATHLETE,"A + TH(LET)E
"
25,Rope with which Henry gets hauled up,HALYARD,"HAL + DRAY reversed
"
26,Problems housing 50 in wretched dwellings,SLUMS,"Insertion of L (50 in Roman numerals) in SUMS.
"
27,Additional matter written about learner driver,PLUS,"Another insertion, of L in PUS. Pus is matter, I suppose, although not a particularly pleasant one to contemplate on a Sunday morning …
"
28,WHISTLE-STOP,A,"charade of WHISTLES (catcalls) and TOP (kill), defining a trip with lots of short halts. Using “politician’s” seemed a bit random to me, unless I’m missing something."
29,OILCANS,A,n insertion of IL (one litre) and CAN (an example of a container) in OS (outsize). I didn’t fall in love with this construction; I think it’s a bit clunky and has a lot going on for a beginner-level puzzle.
30,RELAPSE,A,n anagram (suffering) of (E’S PALER)
31,TOWEL RAIL,A,n insertion of OWELR (LOWER) in TAIL (behind). The anagram indicator is “rough”.
32,IDEAL,A,"homophone of “I deal”, which is what a trader might say or assert."
33,NUMB,,“Company” is a synonym for “number” and two-thirds of that is “numb”. Hmmm.
34,PERPETUATE,A,n anagram (startled) of (UTTER A PEEP)
35,BANKRUPTCY,C,"arey Street, I learned today, is the London thoroughfare where the bankruptcy court used to be situated. This was a new one on me."
36,STEN,A,king (R) taken out of STERN.
37,ALLOW,A,charade of ALL (everyone) and OW! (that hurt). Lovely surface and a fine clue.
38,EBULLIENT,A,"n insertion (in) of BULLIE (briefly intimidated) in ENT. If you’re not already familiar with ENT as “hospital department”, now’s the time. “Ear, Nose and Throat”, and the department where doctors will give you the advice never to put anything in your ear that’s smaller than your elbow."
39,CANASTA,H,"idden in AmeriCAN A STAr. It’s a card game, but I don’t know much about it."
40,DOGGONE,A,"cd. The setter here isn’t Nutmeg, but the four-legged variety, who if he’d sadly snuffed it, would be gone. I presume the definition is “darned”, but I’m not sure what the asterisks are all about."
41,CONNECTICUT,A,charade of CONNECT (associate) I and CUT.
42,WELL-WOMAN CLINIC,A,n anagram (being treated) of (I L CALLOW MEN IN WC)
43,IN ALL,F,inally stripped of its outside letters.
44,TO SPARE,A,"n insertion of SPA in TORE. Rent here is the past tense of the verb to rend, to tear."

46,TALK INTO,TALKING TO,(a carpeting) without G for good.
47,PIPPED AT THE POST,A,cd.
48,ROOT AND BRANCH,A,charade of ROOT (a homophone (we’re told) of route) AND BRANCH (fork).
49,TELL ME ANOTHER,A,n anagram (working) of (ALLOTMENT HERE)
50,FROWNS ON,A,charade of FR (father) and OWN SON. “Supporting” works because it’s a down clue.
51,PRESAGE,A,"n insertion (carrying) of RE (on) and S (son) in PAGE (servant). I didn’t much like this one, because for me, “threaten” is not a good definition of “presage”."
52,COULDN’T,A,n insertion (held) of LD (first letters of locate dissident) in COUNT.
53,LOGIC,A,"n insertion of GI (serviceman) in LOC (reversal of COL, colonel). I wasn’t keen on “stabs” as the insertion indicator."
54,Do exercises in school,TRAIN,"A dd, with the ‘school’ part of the clue functioning as a verb, not a noun.
"
55,"Perform with copper and doctor, to a degree, in a sort of play",DOCUDRAMA,"A clearly signposted five-part charade to give us a shedload of starting letters for the downs: DO + CU + DR + A + MA.
"
56,"Use the least useful thing available, and fix the lot!",SCRAPE THE BARREL,"I did get this once I had a few crossing letters.  The first part of the clue is the definition (ish).  Then I parsed it as SCRAPE (fix as a noun) THE and BARREL (lots, as in a barrel of laughs).  I will, however, fess up to having to phone a friend to get this far*.  Not my favourite clue today, but it could just be me being a bit dim.
"
57,Earliest PM,PREMIER,"A dd.
"
58,Appear in disguise close to ancient balustrade,PARAPET,"**anagram of APPEAR; plus ancienT.
"
59,Swag in sack,LOOT,"A dd, helped by the fact that this word, like so many in English, can be both a verb and noun.
"
60,Saying there’s doubtful merit talking with skinhead,GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE,"**anagram of MERIT TALKING SKINHEAD; Unless this is an attempt at an &lit (which I personally don’t think works), I’m not head over heels in love with this one. The surface is good, and the anagrind is clear once you’ve sussed it; but just to clue this as a ‘saying’ is pretty vague, in my opinion. What do others think?
"
61,Bird spotted in Leatherhead,RHEA,"To my shame, I needed the two crossing letters before I saw this: it’s hidden in LeatheRHEAd.
"
62,Little Bernard has line in flattery,BLARNEY,"An insertion of L (line) in BARNEY, the diminutive name for those called Bernard.
"
63,Ignored an untidy bleeder in resort,TURNED A BLIND EYE,"**anagram of AN UNTIDY BLEEDER; Brilliant surface, brilliant clue.
"
64,"Item on list, part of a shoe",HEELPIECE,"**Item (PIECE) on HEEL. Again playing on the noun/verb usage: here HEEL means to fall over or to ‘list’.
"
65,"Person beyond saving, individual imprisoned by King George",GONER,"An insertion of ONE in GR (George Rex). I’d only been reading in the Observer Review a short time before solving about the acclaimed new film about King George and his stammer. Oscars earwig-o, apparently.
"
66,High flier up for trial,TEST PILOT,"**A cd.
"
67,"Drop unresolved argument with side with a greater ego, possibly",AGREE TO DISAGREE,"**anagram of SIDE A GREATER EGO; Super anagram and clue.
"
68,"Serviette, sort mostly used after game",NAPKIN,"A charade of NAP and KIN (mostly KINd, sort). NAP is a card game, short for Napoleon.
"
69,"Put off, in crude terms",DETER,"Hidden in cruDE TERms.
"
70,"Inexpensive, flag of inferior quality",CHEAPJACK,"A charade of CHEAP and JACK, the flag. It had to be CHEAP, but beyond that I couldn’t see it; a dictionary trawl revealed the answer.  The SOED gives ‘shoddy, inferior’. A new one on me, but very clearly clued.
"
71,"Drawings of Mardi Gras, not right somehow",DIAGRAMS,"anagram of MA[R]DI GRAS; The R (right) is withdrawn from the fodder before making the anagram.
"
72,Very little indeed of what returning US astronauts may expect?,A DROP IN THE OCEAN,"**A cd. The ‘US’ element looks a bit superfluous, but I suppose that Everyman may be making a contrast with the Russian cosmonauts, who come to Earth over the remoter land masses of the country. Whatevs, a nice clue.
"
73,Earmark a tax to be raised,ALLOT,"A charade of A and TOLL reversed (raised, since this is a down clue).
"
74,Note amateur runs ahead of champion in track event,RELAY RACE,"**A lovely charade of RE (the second note of the tonic sol-fa, and a drop of golden sun for fans of *The Sound of Music*) LAY (amateur) R (runs) and ACE (champion).
"
75,Trivia is what one may get in the pub,SMALL BEER,"**A cd cum dd. While it’s a pretty familiar expression, I wasn’t sure of its origin, and a quick flirt online wasn’t much help apart from suggesting that it was a synonym for ‘weak beer’.
"
76,Shallow type involved in leak,SKIN,"-DEEP**Lovely construction: it’s KIND (type) inserted into SEEP (leak).
"
77,Urge small number to have good warming drink,EGGNOG,"**A charade of EGG (urge) NO (small number) and G for good. A mixture of cream, eggs, sugar and a spirit of your choice, and especially popular in North America during winter celebrations.
"
78,Clubs in English city making a collection,BATCH,"An insertion of C for clubs (as in cards) in the beautiful spa city of BATH.
"
79,Poet may show anger about ending in limerick,RILKE,"An insertion of K (ending in limerick) in RILE. No, I hadn’t either. A Bohemian-Austrian poet who died in 1926.  His haunting images focus on the difficulty of communion with the ineffable in an age of disbelief, solitude and profound anxiety: themes that tend to position him as a transitional figure between the traditional and modern poets, since you ask. 
"
80,PARTHENON,A,nice charade of PAR (RAP reversed or back) THEN (previously) and ON (about). Someone who knows more about Classics than I do will give you chapter and verse on the structure. 
81,WAIST,A,n anagram (about) of (WAS IT)
82,LAPTOPS,A,"charade of L (learner, beginner) APT and OPS (works). OP is an abbreviation of opus, the musical work, and is very common in crosswordland."
83,OCTOBER,A,charade of OCT (of Celtic tradition first letters) and (ROBE). The anagrind is ‘new’.
84,SEIZE,A,"homophone of ‘sees’, or watches. ‘Reportedly’ is the homophone indicator. Are these two words homophones? You’ve reached the age of consent, so you decide."
85,MONOMANIA,A,"charade of MONO (single) MAN (guy) and IA (A1, excellent, reversed). A slightly unusual word, but clearly clued."
86,ELECTION ADDRESS,A,"charade of ELECTION (choice) and ADDRESS (location). Fine as far as the clue is concerned, but the enumeration is given as (15) and not (8,7) which meant that once I’d discovered that ELECTIONEERING didn’t fit, I was left scratching my head."
87,TREATISES,A,n anagram (‘broadcast’) of (E ARTISTES). ‘A spoken or written story or narrative’ (SOED).
88,CAMEL,A,charade of CAME and L for lake. I may have seen this once or twice before.
89,BOLIVAR,A,"charade of BO (body odour, personal problem) and (RIVAL). The currency of Venezuela."
90,WHATNOT,A,"n anagram of (THAT WON). The anagrind is ‘reappraisal’. ‘A stand with shelves, used for keeping or displaying small objects’ (SOED)"
91,BESET,A,"n inclusion of E (East, a quarter) in BEST."
92,OPALESCENT,I,liked this one. It’s a charade of O (love) PALE and SCENT.
93,GRAPHITE,M,oley has not produced a carbon-neutral crossword for us today. Here’s the second mention for the element with atomic number 6. It’s an anagram of (GREAT HIP).
94,CHOOSE,A,"charade of CH for church, OO (circles) and SE (south, east, two points of the compass)."
95,GNUS,A,pretty obvious anagram of (GUNS).
96,INSOMNIACS,A,n anagram of (CASINOS MIN). The anagrind is ‘fantastic’. Setters often use ‘mainly’ in this way to tell you that you need to lose the last letter of the word indicated; here MINE becomes MIN.
97,TWO-TIMED,A,"charade of TWO, TIME and D for died."
98,RIBBON,A,"charade of RIB and BON (BONE, trimmed of its last letter)."
99,STIR,H,idden in teST IRrational. ‘Some’ tells you to look for a hidden answer.
100,MOONSTRUCK,A,"charade of MOON, our satellite and STRUCK. ‘Deranged or mad’ (Collins). One of several words suggesting lunacy relating to the moon."
101,ABSOLUTION,A,charade of AB (Able-Bodied Sailor) and SOLUTION.
102,TITIVATE,G,"allery is almost always TATE. If you put it and IV (Roman numeral for 4) inside it, you have your answer. The clue is surrounded by square brackets. Does anyone have a notion why?"
103,EMMENTAL,I,"liked this clue a lot, especially for its smooth surface. It might be a bit of a stretch for a beginner though. It’s an anagram of (METAL). You’re then invited to ‘box (in)’ MEN or ‘workers’."
104,ENLIST,A,"charade of EN (East, North) and LIST. Plenty of compass points today."
105,CRAYON,A,charade of CRAY and ON.
106,BABY,A,"further charade of BA (graduate) and BY. Simple, but good."
107,WARP,A,"s you will have seen, the clue is ??? (4). Occasionally, you do get odd clues like this, but in a Quiptic? So brains were racked to no effect before sticking the crossing letters into a wordsearch, which suggested nothing likely. So I cheated, finished the puzzle and then said a really, really bad word about the Crossword Editor, because I can only imagine that this is down to him. ‘Edit. Bring into order for publication’ (SOED). But clearly not today."
108,THINKING,A,"charade of THIN (poor) and KING (ruler), and a witty start to the acrosses."
109,BRENDA,A,n insertion (covering) of END in BRA
110,GNAT,A,reversal (rejected) of TANG
111,CANDIDATES,I,needed some crossing letters to get this: it’s a charade of CAN (Canadian) DI (girl) and DATES (goes out with).
112,HAMMER,H,idden (stocked) in GrantHAM MERchant.
113,SMARTEST,A,ries is of course the star sign of the Ram; so Arians are Rams.  Reversing (returning) this gives us SMAR and adding TEST (exam) gives us the answer.
114,MONACO,A,n anagram of (O MAN) plus CO for company.  A really clever surface.
115,CEMENT,A,"charade of CE (Civil Engineer), MEN (labourers) and T (beginning to test).  Again, the surface reads very well."
116,SEASCAPE,M,"y last one to go in.  It’s another charade of S (Saint) and an insertion (in) of A (Augustine’s head) in ESCAPE, to flee."
117,TITIAN,T,"he famous painter is an insertion of I for island in TITAN, from Greek mythology.  Titans were members of a family of giants, the offspring of Uranus (Heaven) and Gaia (Earth).  They got into a bit of a spat with Zeus and came off second best.  That’ll learn ’em."
118,REVELATION,V,"ery clever: it’s a kind of cd, since if a clergyman was delighted, it would be a REV ELATION."
119,DOOR,I,"t’s a reversal (back) of ROOD. ‘A crucifix, especially one stationed above the middle of a rood screen’ (SOED).  I wonder if Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh is derived from this meaning?"
120,BEREFT,A,"n anagram of (FREE BT).  The anagrind is ‘deal’, in the sense of dealing out (and therefore changing the position of) cards."
121,FLOUNDER,A,dd.
122,PHANTASM,I,"couldn’t see this for ages, yet hidden answers are supposed to be the easiest to spot.  It’s tucked away in ElePHANT AS Mate, and this is indicated by the ‘of’.  A slightly unusual word, but since it’s staring you in the face, fair play."
123,KNIT,A,"charade of K for King, monarch, and NIT."
124,MINCER,A,n anagram of (CRIME) with N for new inserted.  The anagrind is ‘organised’ and the insertion indicator is ‘to steal’.
125,ABDICATE,A,charade of A (BID) CAT and E for Earl.  The anagrind is ‘suspect’.
126,DEPARTMENT,,(TEN TRAMPED)  The anagrind is ‘around’.
127,ADDERS,I,"smiled at this one, but it’s a tad cheeky.  The definition is ‘snakes’: their partners on board are of course LADDERS; if you chop the head off this word you’ve got your answer.  The slight liberty in my opinion is the stretch from ‘executed’ to ‘beheaded’."
128,MINISTERED,,(SIN MERITED)  The anagrind is ‘awful’.
129,CHAPATTI,A,"clever charade of CHAP AT TI.  TI is a homophone of ‘tea’, a meal, and ‘heard’ is the homophone indicator."
130,TEA TOWEL,T,his is T (end of Oktoberfest) plus (WEE A LOT)  The anagrind is ‘drunk’.  Interesting image that the surface reading provides …
131,BELIEF,BEEF,", a complaint, surrounding LI (Light Infantry)."
132,ELEVEN,EVEN,(flat) ‘housing’ LE (the in French).  Pan has put ‘say’ at the end to indicate that a football team is just one example of an ‘eleven’.
133,TENDON,H,idden in frostbitTEN DONor.
134,DUNG,A,n insertion of N for Nitrogen in DUG.
135,Fan in seat wriggling about so,ENTHUSIAST,"An insertion of THUS in anagram of IN SEAT;
"
136,"Mark on skin causing alarm, no end",SCAR,"SCAR[E] with no end.
"
137,Wife’s mother at home with rules and regulations?,IN,"-LAW**A rather obvious clue.
"
138,Film of past committee,OVERBOARD,"A 1987 rom-com which I must admit I’d never heard of, but the charade of OVER and BOARD is very clear. There’s a remake coming out this year, apparently.
"
139,Rows across a river in Spanish city,LINARES,"An insertion of A + R in LINES. Lovely surface, leading us to the Andalusian city.
"
140,Inn with a small restaurant,TAVERNA,"TAVERN plus A. Simple, but good.
"
141,A source of treasure in Valencia? Dad’s mistaken,ALADDIN,"’S CAVE**anagram of VALENCIA DAD’S; and a further Spanish reference.
"
142,Teacher nastily shamed sister,HEADMISTRESS,"anagram of SHAMED SISTER;
"
143,Letters received ahead of good job taken with airline,POSTBAG,"A charade of POST, BA (British Airways or Bloody Awful, depending on your experience with them) and G.
"
144,Dour expert’s frown,GRIMACE,"A charade of GRIM and ACE. This one’s been round the block a few times.
"
145,"Somehow I fall, poor victim of hoax",APRIL FOOL,"**anagram of I FALL POOR;
"
146,How movie ends is unimaginative,INANE,"Because ‘movie’ ends in an ‘e’! This one really made me smile, but it was my last one in, because for me ‘unimaginative’ is not synonymous with ‘inane’. I’d choose ‘silly’ or ‘senseless’ and since ‘unimaginative’ isn’t central to the clue I wonder why Everyman didn’t choose another adjective.
"
147,Be mindful of college turning,NOTE,"A reversal of ETON, the college where half the current cabinet spent their time warming lavatory seats for each other and preparing for high office. This one’s been following GRIMACE around the same block.
"
148,Bitter line written in a hospital department,ASTRINGENT,"Nice clue: it’s STRING inserted in A ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat department, the setters’ favourite hospital unit).
"
149,Fit to eat in deli? Be worried.,EDIBLE,"anagram of DELI BE; Bit of an odd surface, I thought, until my failing eyesight revealed that it was DELI and not DELL.
"
150,"Gift, article left in shelter",TALENT,"An insertion of A + L in TENT.
"
151,Like a member of the jet set?,UPWARDLY MOBILE,"**A cd, and one that again is a bit well-worn.
"
152,Those having great stamina in club teams?,IRONSIDES,"A charade of IRON (golf club) and SIDES. The SOED indicates bravery rather than stamina, and references particularly Edmund II and Oliver Cromwell.
"
153,Kind of dessert,SWEET,"A dd.
"
154,Tea girl’s name for Mao?,CHAIRMAN,"A charade of CHA, IRMA and N.
"
155,"Unorthodox lad described by globetrotter, old tennis star",ROD LAVER,"**An insertion of anagram of LAD; in ROVER. The Australian left-hander is now 72: he was only 1.70m tall and about 70kg dripping wet, but he wasn’t half good.
"
156,Like Caesar’s wife over hint?,ABOVE SUSPICION,"**A charade of ABOVE (over) and SUSPICION (hint). It’s referring to the phrase ‘Caesar’s wife must be above suspicion’. Somebody who knows more about classics than I do* will give you chapter and verse.
"
157,Unconventional Irish soldier?,IRREGULAR,"A charade of IR and REGULAR.
"
158,Comedian entertaining a clergyman,CHAPLAIN,"Lovely surface: it’s an insertion of A in Charlie CHAPLIN.
"
159,Snark and its strange language,SANSKRIT,"anagram of SNARK ITS;
"
160,A drop of red in buffet in appropriate container,CARAFE,"Insertion of A + R (a drop of red) in CAFE. Anyone else think that café for buffet is a bit of a stretch?
"
161,Failing to change sides,DEFECT,"A dd. The noun has the stress on the first syllable, the verb on the second. Learners of ESOL must love that kind of stuff.
"
162,Misleading explanation for grand deficit,GLOSS,"A charade of G and LOSS.
"
163,Footwear for each fielder takes precedence,SLIPPER,"A charade of PER (for each) and SLIP (fielder in cricket).  The ‘takes precedence’ tells you to reverse the order.
"
164,Highlight dot above the horizon,POINT UP,"**A charade.  I wasn’t madly keen on ‘above the horizon’ for UP.
"
165,Primate interrupts priest’s scholarly discourse,PAPER,"An insertion of APE in PR for priest.  ‘Interrupts’ is the insertion indicator.  Nice surface, since Primate also has a religious sense.
"
166,Vagrant’s on the way out when Commie comes back in,WANDERING,"Another insertion, this time with a reversal (‘back in’).  It’s DER (RED, or Commie, reversed) in WANING.
"
167,Celebrity at home in England shedding pounds,LIGHTENING,"More insertions.  It’s LIGHT (celebrity, as in ‘leading light’) and IN (at home) inserted in ENG (England).
"
168,Cut Rolls in a recession,SNUB,"A reversal of BUNS. 
"
169,"What cabaret critic may do, they say, with friend after dark",NOCTURNALLY,"Clever clue.  It’s a homophone of knock turn (criticise an act) plus ALLY.  ‘They say’ is the homophone indicator.
"
170,Extra payment almost rejected by attendant not paying attention,UNOBSERVANT,"There’s a bit going on here.  BONU is nearly BONUS; ‘rejected’ tells you to reverse it to give UNOB; adding SERVANT gives you the solution.
"
171,Vehicles to carry instruments failing to start,UTES,"UTE is Australian slang for a utility vehicle and is a word I only know from crosswords.  It’s a shortening (failing to start) of LUTES. 
"
172,Where you might lie bottom in pairs’ event,DOUBLE BEDS,"**I got DOUBLE fairly quickly from the crossing letters, but the full clue was my last to go in.  It’s a cleverly constructed surface, but again, there’s some stuff happening.  The pairs event is DOUBLES (tennis, I suppose) and ‘in’ is telling you to insert BED (bottom, of the sea) into it.
"
173,Apt headgear for a Victorian engagement?,BALACLAVA,"A dd, referring to the 1854 battle of Balaclava in the Crimean War and the knitted headwear.  The two are related but I can’t remember why.
"
174,Girl steps back over single plant,SISAL,"A very common clue: it’s a reveral of LASS with the insertion of I for ‘single’.
"
175,"What Thomas wanted, I assume",NO DOUBT,"**A kind of cd/dd.  It’s referring to the phrase ‘Doubting Thomas’,  which has its origins in the desire of the Apostle Thomas to see and feel Jesus’ wounds before believing that the resurrection had taken place.  It’s in John Chapter 20 if you’re remotely interested and there’s also a dead famous painting by Caravaggio of the event.
"
176,"Spurs supporter often does this, masking identification",SIDINGS,"Cleverly misleading use of ‘Spurs supporter’.  You need to tease them apart, since the definition is ‘spurs’: it’s an insertion of ID in SINGS, which is what supporters do (except when they’re being taunted by the opposition chant ‘You only sing when you’re winning, sing when you’re winning …’)
"
177,Contribute gracefully,SUPPLY,"A dd.  With the stress on the first syllable, it means the first word of the clue; when it’s on the second syllable, it is an adverb synonymous with the second word of the clue.  *This is in fact the other way round; thanks to Eileen for pointing out my error.*
"
178,One man chucking article for dog to have a go at,IMPUGN,"Good surface and sound clue, but a beginner might struggle with it.  Impugn: ‘to fight against; attack; assail; assault’ (SOED).  ‘One man’ is I MAN, given the crossword convention of the letter I for ‘one’.  Nutmeg is then inviting you to ‘chuck (out) the article A and replace it with PUG, a dog.
"
179,Cromwell’s doctrine destroyed human spirit after beheading,PURITANISM,"Our first anagram: anagram of UMAN SPIRIT;. ‘Beheading’ tells you to take the first letter off and ‘destroyed’ is the anagrind.
"
180,Archbishop’s tree,ROWAN,"A dd.  You need to know that Rowan Williams is the current Archbishop of Canterbury.  Think beard, glasses and well-modulated accent.
"
181,Part of continent where Alpine sun’s unusual,PENINSULA,"Another anagram: anagram of ALPINE SUN;.  The anagrind is ‘unusual’.
"
182,Independent police force raised issue,ITEM,"A charade of I for independent and TEM, a reversal of MET (The Metropolitan Police).  Since this is a down clue, ‘raised’ serves as the reversal indicator.
"
183,Warning sign in kitchen?,TRIANGLE,"I have stared at this for long enough.  I have no idea, so in the interests of getting this blog out before it gets dark, I’ll ask for some help with parsing this, please!  *A suggestion below from pommers looks feasible, but Gaufrid at no 4 has come to our rescue with the explanation that it’s an orchestral reference.  Thanks to both.*
"
184,Unlimited buns and puddings served up without hassle,UNSTRESSED,"Again, the need to see two devices.  ‘Unlimited buns’ gives you UN, ‘buns’ without the first and last letters.   Puddings are DESSERTS and ‘served up’ tells you in a down clue to reverse it.  Put the two together and you’ve got your answer.  If you’ve not seen the STRESSED/DESSERTS trick before, you will again soon.
"
185,Mister Uppity feeds comic cartoon bird,CORMORANT,"This is another clue that’s really clever, but possibly doesn’t sit well in an entry-level crossword.  It’s an insertion of RM anagram of Mr, uppity, ie reversed) in an anagram of (CARTOON;.  ‘Feeds’ is the insertion indicator and ‘comic’ is the anagrind.  The Cormorant’s close relation, the Shag, has been known to be of use to setters with a risqué sense of humour.
"
186,Narrow-minded sports coach backs prohibition,SUBURBAN,"Again, lots of elements to tease out.  ‘Narrow-minded’ is the definition (‘surburban’ wouldn’t have been my first choice of synonym, but it’s in the SOED as ‘derogatory’).  ‘Prohibition’ is BAN; ‘sports coach’ is RU (Rugby Union) plus BUS (coach); ‘back’ tells you to reverse these elements and when you do, you’ve got the answer.  By which time you probably need a lie-down.
"
187,Paragon directed cast,MODELLED,"This is simpler: a charade of MODEL and LED.
"
188,Argue about a child,REASON,"Another charade, of RE (about) and A SON.
"
189,Surreptitiously takes round small religious book,PSALMS,"PALMS (surreptitiously takes) round S for small gives you the book of the bible.
"
190,Animals’ stomachs,BEARS,"A dd.
"
191,The crudest clothes colour,ECRU,"Nice clue to finish.  It’s hidden in ThE CRUdest; ‘clothes’ is the indicator.
"
192,Second drink in isolated spot,BACKWATER,"A charade of BACK and WATER.
"
193,Glimpse object of especial interest,SIGHT,"This one took me a while to understand.  It’s a dd: if you glimpse something, you sight it; and if something is of especial interest, then it’s a ‘sight’ to see.  I got focused on Everyman’s use of ‘especial’ rather than ‘special’, thinking that must have been central to the clue.  Wrong.
"
194,Taking photographs of spectators where marksmen practise,SHOOTING GALLERY,"A straighforward charade of SHOOTING (taking photographs) and GALLERY (spectators).
"
195,Land shortage ignored by duke,EARTH,"A removal of D from DEARTH.
"
196,Maintenance allowance Olympian squandered,PALIMONY,"anagram of OLYMPIAN;  It’s a term derived from PAL and ALIMONY, where the assets of a live-in but unmarried couple are divvied out after separation.  A quick flirt online suggests the neologism dates from 1977.
"
197,"Literary character, jumping bail, put in prison",CALIBAN,"An insertion of anagram of BAIL; in CAN for prison.  A character in Shakespeare’s Tempest.
"
198,"Likely to remain fine in South, possibly after about one",SET FAIR,"A charade of S anagram of South) and (AFTER; around I for one.
"
199,"After last of nightmares, refuse to sleep",SLUMBER,"A charade of S and LUMBER.
"
200,Pal carrying revolutionary weapon,MACHETE,"An insertion of CHE, the setters’ favourite revolutionary, in MATE.
"
201,Cop loses out in disgusting place,CESSPOOL,"anagram of COP LOSES;
"
202,Itinerant US actor making a comeback,NOMAD,"A reversal of DAMON.  Referring to Matt Damon, the US actor.  I’m not that into cinema, but even I’d heard of him.
"
203,Fruit British head dropped into perfect drink,BUTTERNUT SQUASH,"Clever.  It’s B for British and NUT inserted into UTTER (perfect) and SQUASH (drink).  This seems to crop up a lot in crosswords, perhaps because it’s got fifteen letters and is ripe (no pun intended) for cluing in various ways.  Like the tomato, it is technically a fruit, although cooks would probably regard it as a vegetable.
"
204,Helped let learner driver out,EASED,"LEASED with the removal of L.
"
205,As good as gold?  Not us,RUNNERS,"-UPA cd.
"
206,"A nervous wreck in box, on trial",BASKET CASE,"A charade of BASKET and CASE.  I’d normally associate this word with the recent difficulties of the PIGS eurozone, but the SOED does give the ‘nervous wreck’ definition.
"
207,Group of singers sing endlessly about love,CHOIR,"An insertion of O for love in CHIR[P].
"
208,Perform a baptism to celebrate a birth,WET THE BABY,"’S HEADA dd.
"
209,Can one holding drill start to repair a kitchen utensil?,TIN OPENER,"Can (TIN) plus ONE enclosing PE (drill) and first letter of repair.
"
210,Royal feast cut short,REGAL,"REGAL[E].  This is the nounal version of REGALE: ‘a sumptuous meal, a feast, an entertainment’.
"
211,"I’m unfortunately turned over by a trick, a computer fraud",SALAMI TECHNIQUE,"A reversal of I’M ALAS plus TECHNIQUE.  I vaguely knew this term, and on checking I find that it’s a method of fraudulently obtaining funds by regularly taking small amounts of money from accounts, so that it won’t be noticed: a bit like slicing a salami very thinly until you’ve got the whole sausage, I suppose.
"
212,"New measuring device, reportedly for fruit",GREENGAGE,"A charade of GREEN (new, naive) and GAGE, a homophone of ‘gauge’, a measuring device.
"
213,Film and play opening in Soho,TOYS,"A charade of TOY (play) and S.  A 1992 comedy, which I had never heard of; but the answer couldn’t be much else.
"
214,Amity shown by female diner relaxed on liner,FRIENDSHIP,"A charade of F, anagram of DINER; and SHIP.
"
215,Rule at sea confused eminent poets,LAUREATES,"anagram of RULE AT SEA;
"
216,Dope easy to name,SIMPLETON,"A charade of SIMPLE, TO and N.
"
217,Proprietor in state of depression having day off,OWNER,"[D]OWNER
"
218,Upset mason grumbles,MOANS,"anagram of MASON;
"
219,Efficient porter grabbing first of bags,ABLE,"An insertion of B in ALE.
"
220,DOMICILE,A,charade of ICI (‘here’ in French) and L in DOME.
221,SCAR,A,"reversal (coming round) of RAC’s.  For overseas solvers, RAC is the Royal Automobile Club, a roadside rescue organisation.  Their motorbike people used to salute you when they saw the RAC badge on the front of the car, which tells you how old I am."
222,MANUMIT,A,"charade of MAN U and MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).  Given the events at Wembley on Saturday, Quixote thankfully decided not to involve the red-and-white side of Manchester in the clue.  Why is Massachusetts so hard to spell?"
223,LETS RIP,A,charade of vigi[L] and (PRIEST)
224,LORD PRIVY SEAL,,(V SILLY PADRE OR)
225,PARODISTS,A,charade of PAR and ODISTS for poets.
226,TWEED ,T,"his is obvious, being the river that forms some of the border between England and Scotland.  Even with all the crossing letters in I couldn’t see it and had TREAD for a good while, thinking that it was something that ran along the edge of a tyre.  Perhaps I should go back to just doing the Quiptic."
227,Let the love of our land’s sacred rights,T,"o the love of our people succeed*Let friendship and honour unite*
"
228,ROGUE,A,n insertion of G into ROUÉ for rake.
229,AUSTENITE,M,"y last to go in.  I presumed (always a dangerous strategy when solving a cryptic) that it was an anagram of (AUNTIE SET), with ‘puzzle’ as the anagrind.  So it turned out, although the word itself was unfamiliar.  ‘A solid solution of carbon in a non-magnetic high-temperature allotropic form of iron’ (SOED).  I’m always pleased to see a science-based clue, so I’m not going to whinge about its obscurity, especially since it’s an anagram."
230,NEIGHBOURHOOD,NEIGH,"(beastly noise) plus BOD (fellow) outside UR (the famous old city) and HO for house and O for old.  A bit going on, but it’s all clearly signposted.  Perhaps Quixote is going for the record number of elements in a charade, but I’m too much of a new kid on the blog to say whether he gets that particular sticker."
231,INVERSE,N,"ot prosaic would be ‘in verse’, and INVERSE means contrary.  I liked this one when I finally twigged it."
232,DORMANT,DO,and RANT with M for maiden (over) hidden in the middle.  Cricket and Cryptics are BFFE.
233,GARB,T,"he actress Greta GARB[O] without the O for nothing.  A bit like in Casablanca, where her fellow Swede Ingrid Bergman never said ‘Play it again, Sam’, she never said ‘I want to be alone’  in Grand Hotel.  Apparently."
234,RELEASED,A,dd.
235,DUMP,A,reversal (turned over) of P for musically soft and MUD for slime.
236,MANGLER,A,n insertion of ANGLE (point of view) in MR.
237,CAMBRIDGESHIRE,I,"initially put in a misspelling of CARMARTHENSHIRE here, which wasn’t a big help.  Pretty obviously it’s (BEGRIMED HIS CAR)"
238,LIT UP,LIP,for audacity around TU for Trade Union.
239,CORTEGE,A,cd.
240,ROPE LADDER,A,nother cd.
241,ELLIPSIS,I,think that this is ELLIPS[E] plus IS but would welcome confirmation or another parsing.
242,STAYS THE COURSE,,(YOUTH ACTRESSES)
243,UPBRINGING,I,"really liked this one too.  I could see that there was a ‘reversal’ indicator to get from ‘boy’ to ‘yob’, but the bracketed bit of the clue took me a while to work out."
244,SEASONED,C,hildren clued as SEED with the inclusion of A SON.
245,GRIEVER,GRI,[M] plus EVER.
246,INDIANS,DIA,", a reversal of AID in INNS."
247,RIDGE,H,"idden in 3dn, CambRIDGEshire.  It’s ‘surprising’ because, if I may be forgiven for lapsing into the vernacular, the Fenlands in Cambridgeshire are as flat as a kipper’s dick."
248,STUD,H,"alf of STUDents, learners. And ‘stud’ and ‘boss’ are synonyms."
249,Snatch sailor’s pipe,ABDUCT,"A charade of AB for Able-Bodied sailor and DUCT.  I suppose if you were being picky you could suggest that since the clue contains a possessive, it leads to ABSDUCT.  Personally I’m not in a picky mood this morning.
"
250,Pop out in Burlesque star’s helicopter,CHOPPER,"anagram of POP; inserted into CHER.  I couldn’t understand the Burlesque reference but a quick furtle online shows that Cher starred in a film of that name in 2010.
"
251,Lie has fooled doctor,FALSEHOOD,"anagram of HAS FOOLED;  The anagrind is ‘doctor’.
"
252,Feel sorry for decapitated bird,EGRET,"REGRET without the first letter.
"
253,Provide black belt,BRING,"A charade of B for black and RING.
"
254,Spoon and dish expressly for fruit,NECTARINE,"Unless someone has a better idea, I think this is a homophone (suggested by ‘expressly’) of NECK and TUREEN.  The definition of  ‘spoon’ is the amorous one, where when you cuddle somone, you ‘neck’ them.  Not that I’d know much about that, obviously, at my advanced age.  *Update: of course it’s terrine, not tureen.  Thanks to scchua and Stella.*
"
255,I left medicine for distribution in a particular area, ENDEMIC,"anagram of MEDICNE;  Hectence is asking you to take out the I from MEDICINE before making the anagram, suggested by ‘for distribution’.  Nice surface.
"
256,Half of lime for Queen’s alternative to alcoholic drink,LIQUOR,"A charade of LI, QU and OR.
"
257,Join forces with UN soldiers retreating to base camp,SIGN UP,"Perhaps one of the harder ones: it’s a reversal of UN GIS and P, which is the bottom, or base, of camP.
"
258,Shrink articles on dress style taking a quarter out,ANALYST,"Again, quite a tricky one: ‘shrink’ is the anagram of psycho)analyst and you need two articles (AN and A) on LYST, which is (STYL;.  The ‘quarter’ which you need to take out is E for East.
"
259,Unending fog on a little road round bends is dangerous …,HAZARDOUS,"If you’d got the Z from the down clue then it could never be anything else, but parsing it took me some time.  It’s a charade of HAZ (unending HAZe), A, RD for little road, O for round, and U and S for U-bend and S-bend.  I think.
"
260,suggest travel on motorway coming back,IMPLY,"A charade of PLY (travel) after IM, the M1 motorway, coming back.  The southern end of the M1 is not a stretch you’d want to be using during this morning’s commute.  The ellipses in 22 and 24ac are, as usual, five-eighths of naff all to do with anything.
"
261,Mia organised leave with friend from Madrid,AMIGO,"A simple charade of anagram of MIA; and GO.
"
262,"Father’s taking a trip, playing bridge",PATRIARCH,"A charade of anagram of A TRIP; and ARCH.  The anagrind is ‘playing’.
"
263,Cat having a hard time gets meaner,TIGHTER,"An insertion of H for hard and T for time in TIGER.
"
264,Snake swallowing up fish becomes dormant,ASLEEP,"An insertion of LEE (a reversal of EEL) in ASP.  Some people would argue that this clue is faulty, because you can only use ‘up’ as a reversal indicator in a down clue.  I’m one of them.
"
265,Friendly fellow in story,AFFABLE,"An insertion of F in A FABLE.
"
266,Indian capital emerged from citadel Hindus built,DELHI,"Hidden in citaDEL HIndus.
"
267,Minister’s chapter left Germany in disarray,CLERYGYMAN,"A charade of C for chapter, L for left and anagram of GERMANY;.  The anagrind is ‘in disarray’.
"
268,Will supplement from fish get old chemical company money?,CODICIL,"A charade of COD, ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) and L for pounds as money.  A codicil is the thingy you tack onto the end of your will when you’ve fallen out with someone.
"
269,Times returned in last letter,OMEGA,"The last letter of the Greek alphabet is a reversal of two words for ‘time’: AGE and MO (as in ‘just a mo’).
"
270,Prison may result in penny-pinching!,PARSIMONY,"anagram of PRISON MAY;  Nice clue.
"
271,"Sailor’s knocked head over heels by girl – yes, indeed!",RATHER,"Another lovely story-telling surface.  A reversal of TAR added to HER (girl). ‘Rather!’ is what posh folk say to mean ‘Yes, indeed!’
"
272,Toothache’s half gone after taking first nip of brandy,COGNAC,"This might be step too far for a Quiptic, although to be fair to Hectence you have got three crossing letters and it’s a clear definition.  It’s a charade of COG for tooth and AC (ACHE with half missing) surrounding N (first letter of nip).
"
273,Daughter starts off whingeing as it’s raining a bit,DRIZZLING,"A charade of D and [G]RIZZLING.
"
274,Puts rider in and completes course,QUALIFIES,"A dd.
"
275,Shakespearean dismisses love with flourish!,PROSPER,"A removal of O for love (as in tennis) from PROSPER[O], a protagonist in *The Tempest*.
"
276,Donkeys carrying a ton of goods,ASSETS,"An insertion of T in ASSES.
"
277,"Play with posh offspring at Hamleys, say",TOYSHOP,"A charade of TOY for ‘play anagram of with)’ and (SHOP;.  Is ‘offspring’ an appropriate anagrind?  Your call.  Hamleys is the toyshop in London (Oxford Street, I think).
"
278,Cross in defeat,THWART,"I think this is just a dd, but would be happy to be proved wrong.
"
279,Egg’s found in strange sort of place for birds to nest,ROOST,"This time it’s O represented as an egg that you need to insert into anagram of SORT;.  The anagrind is ‘strange’.
"
280,Design super handbag for American girl,PURSE,"Hectence is exploiting one of the many hundreds anagram of thousands?) of words that are different in American and British English.  It’s (SUPER;, the anagrind is ‘design’, and perhaps an American commenter will tell us what their ladies call a purse, ‘cos I don’t know.
"
281,DECAMP,A,"n insertion of M for minute in DECAP, which is PACED backwards."
282,ECLIPSES,I,"t’s CLIPS, cuts, in a reversal of diocese, SEE."
283,MANILA,I,"t’s the capital of somewhere I haven’t time to look up, and it’s MAN plus a reversal of ALI."
284,FORGET IT!,A,charade of TIT (bird) following FORGE (fashion).  Liked this one.
285,BEETLE CRUSHERS,A,"homophone (sound of) those who would want to put down the Fab Four, The Beatles.  I presume BEETLE CRUSHERS are footwear, but I’m too young to remember and too rushed to look it up."
286,FILL THE GAP,A,n anagram of (HALF PIGLET)
287,DELI,A,reversal of I LED (light emitting diode).
288,RAKE,A,double definition.
289,FLATFISHES,A,"n insertion of TFI (reversal of one foot) in FLASHES.  Great clue, where Nutmeg is making use of the fact that the plural of members of the fish family is often the same as the singular."
290,HUNGER STRIKERS,A,"very clever clue, exploiting the two versions of the word ‘fast’."
291,IN DETAIL,I,t’s hidden (to some extent) in a reversal of humiLIATED NIxon.
292,ARDOUR,B,ecause folk from the East End of London allegedly say ‘arder for harder.  But it’s a good surface.
293,ODDEST,T,"he definition’s ‘most rum’, but beyond that, I’m going to ask the audience."
294,DIME,A,charade of DIM and E for English.
295,CONGEAL,A,n insertion of (GONE) in CAL for California.
296,MILITATE,T,"his is phone a friend time, since I’ve used up ask the audience."
297,CHOIRMASTER,,(RICH MAESTRO’S)  Nice almost &lit.
298,INGEST,C,lever.  A homophone of  IN JEST.
299,SO THERE!,A,"charade of SOT (the regular letters of ‘escort’) and HERE, in attendance."
300,SATISFIES,A,"n anagram of (IF TEA IS) inside SS, ‘on board’ a ship."
301,EVERLASTING,A,"charade of TING, the sound of a bell after (SEVERAL)"
302,FORTHWITH,A,kind of double definition: the famous bridge over the River Forth has a reputation for needing constant repainting.
303,BICKERED,T,"ough for a Quiptic: it’s C (the leader in Cheerleader, inserted into BIKE and then followed by RED for traffic light."
304,KINGDOM,A,"gain, very cleverly done: it’s (DOING) inside K and M as the two abbreviations for ‘thousands’.  Great surface."
305,HORMONE,A,n insertion of MO for doctor in HORN (cape) with the addition of E (last of ‘male’).
306,BEAT UP,N,utmeg is asking you to transfer the first two letters of UPBEAT to the end.
307,GRIT,A,charade of GR for King George (in Latin) and IT.
308,HALT,A,"n insertion of L for Lake in HAT, of which boater is an example (which is why Nitsy has included ‘maybe’ in the clue)."
309,WATCHMAN,H,"ands up those who had to search online or elsewhere for the collective noun for nightingales?  Yes, thought so.  It’s that term, WATCH, followed by MAN and the definition is of course ‘guard’.  MAN for ‘dog’ I couldn’t really see, apart from perhaps the phrase ‘There’s life in the old dog yet’, which is normally applied to men not dogs.  Others will put me right, no doubt."
310,COCKTAIL LOUNGES,T,"he clue is ‘Old-fashioned drinking places?’   This seems like a straight or pretty weak (I would say ‘flimsy’ but the setter’s probably fed up with that rubbish pun) double definition to me, but I’m very likely missing something.  I am: sidey at no 6 has the explanation for us, for which thanks."
311,SOLEMNISE,A,"charade of SOLE, M for male, SIN (ill) reversed and E for end of lifE.  I think this is why I struggled a bit with the puzzle: there were a number of clues where there were plenty of elements to take into account."
312,TYPE,H,"idden (involved) in KaTY PErry.  Never heard of her, but she’s probably some cleb.  Edit: this is cleverer than I thought; see Peter’s comment at no 2."
313,ECHELON,A,"gain, tough but just about fair.  You have to know (or discover, in my case) that HEL is the Norse goddess of the underworld and then make an anagram of ONCE to surround it.  ‘Position’ is okay for the definition, I suppose (it’s in my Thesaurus).  A quick look on the internet suggests that the goddess and our word HELL are cognate, which is how I’ll try to remember it next time it comes up."
314,TEAPOT,A,charade of TEA[K] and a reversal of TOP.  Nice surface.
315,SPONGE,A,"word for someone who’s drunk is a charade of S for soprano, PONG and E for last letter in ‘piecE’."
316,ENTREAT,A,"nother charade: ‘unfinished dish’ is ENTRE[E] plus A, and T for a ‘bit’ of ‘Trifle’."
317,LAMB,A,charade of LAM for hit and B for book.  Referring no doubt to Charles Lamb.
318,ESPLANADE,A,"fine clue.  ‘Heartlessly’ means that Nitsy’s asking you to remove the ‘heart’ (N) from ‘planned’; if you then make ananagram of what’s left with ‘sea’, you get the answer.
"
319,ANABOLIC STEROID,,(BEAR DISLOCATION)
320,SIDEKICK,,(DIES) plus KICK
321,IDLE,T,"he famous (in Crosswordland, anyway) fish IDE with L included."
322,HUCKSTER,,"‘A pedlar, a hawker’ (SOED).  It’s (STUCK HER) and the clue works; but the surface jarred a bit for me because of course you pedal, not peddle, a bike."
323,LOCAL,A,and L after a reversal of COL.
324,AILMENT,I,"liked this one specially too.  ‘Armour’ is MAIL; take the ‘head’ M to the ‘toe’ and you have AILM; add (TEN) and you’rehome and dry.
"
325,COURT MARTIALED,,"anagram of ROLE IN COMBAT D)  The D is for Deutschland. The ‘American’ bit is there because this relies on the rule in AmericanEnglish that the letter ‘l’ is not doubled in, for example, past or present participles: on our side of the pond we have travelled and are travelling; on theirs they have traveled and have the Traveling Wilburys.  They’ll be telling us that color and theater are more logical spellings next (only joking, guys).  *Edit: as Conrad has kindly pointed out at comment no 4, I’ve carelessly put the wrong anagram fodder: of course, it’s (TRAUMATIC ROLE D;*
"
326,MEGAPHONE,P,"robably my clue of the day for its funny surface with the inclusion of ‘wee’ and ‘tinkle’.  It’s a charade of MEGA for‘huge’ and PHONE for ‘tinkle’, as in ‘Give me a tinkle tomorrow’.  Which, thinking about it, is what your GP might say if he
"
327,NOSE,NO,[I]SE.
328,STUMBLING BLOCK,A,"charade of S, TUMBLING and BLOCK."
329,SIMIAN,A,"n insertion (‘hugged’) of I’M in SIAN. I’m not hugely fond of this kind of clue, where ‘female’ is suggesting any randomgirl’s name, but I’d better get used to it, because setters employ it all the time.  Any road up, that’s what crossing letters
"
330,HAPHAZARD,I,"did get this eventually, but for an average solver like me there’s a lot happening.  The definition is ‘random’ and it’s aninsertion of PHA in HAZARD for (a golfing) bunker.  The PHA comes from an anagram of the starting letters to Annoy Henry Plugged; the anagrind is ‘shot’.
"
331,ATTENDEE,A,"gain, a three-part clue: it’s TEND in ATE for ‘worried’ and E for ‘beginning to eye’."
332,ELEGIAC,I,"’m usually pretty good with spelling, but I stupidly entered ELEGAIC here at first, which was not a great help in gettingthe anagram at 24 ac.  I’d never have parsed this without online help: the ’20’ is referring to 20ac, Charles Lamb, whose
"
333,EXPOSE,A,"n insertion of POS for chamber pots in the oft-referenced River Exe.  ‘PO, A chamber pot (origin French).’   And no Italian river in sight."
334,AVOID,A,for America plus VOID.
335,TAPS,TAP,[E]S.  Tape in its verbal rather than nounal form.
336,Caveman’s grand boxing match?  On the contrary!,FINGAL,"If you’re going to fess up to not understanding a clue, it might as well be 1 Across.  Here’s the first tricky piece of wordplay, which proved too tricky for me.  The caveman reference is from the *Fingal’s Cave Overture *by Mendelssohn, but I need some help with explaining how the clue works.  *Edit: EB and Eileen share the gold star for parsing this for me – see comments 1 and 2.*
"
337,Waffle appearing after meat,RABBIT ON,"A charade of RABBIT and ON, appearing (as in ‘the band is on at eight o’clock’).
"
338,Crazy girl with a crazy song,MADRIGAL,"A charade of MAD and anagram of A GIRL;  Crazy is a definition first time round and an anagrind the second.
"
339,It’s strange – not even Capone has left the country,ODDITY,"A charade of ODD and IT[AL]Y.  ODD is not even, and AL (Capone) has to be removed from the country.
"
340,A cushion possibly sat on quite frequently,AS OFTEN AS NOT,"A charade of A, SOFTEN and anagram of SAT ON;  ‘Cushion’ is used as a verb here and ‘possibly’ is the anagrind.
"
341,Musical performance one must follow,GIGI,"Gigi is the musical; GIG is  performance and Orlando’s inviting you to add I for one at the end.
"
342,Citizen’s native ground – around the northeast,VENETIAN,"anagram of NATIVE; around NE.  ‘Ground’ is the anagrind.  Nice surface.
"
343,"Orlando’s reflected – outside, another setter danced",SHIMMIED,"When the setter mentions him or herself, it’s usually an indication that there’s a me or I involved somewhere.  This is the case here, but it’s complicated by the ‘reflected’ bit.  ‘Orlando’s’ translates to ‘I’m’; when that’s reflected, you’ve got IMMI.  Then you need to put SHED around that to get your answer; ‘danced’ is the definition.  Shed is another setter in the Guardian stable.  I think this clue is a bit unfair for a Quiptic since if you’re only at this level and have never attempted a Guardian Cryptic then you’ve no way of knowing that fact.
"
344,Part of speech originating from parrot,ECHO,"Hidden in speECH Originating.  ‘Parrot’ is the definition.
"
345,Accountants collected a recent bonus,BEAN COUNTERS,"anagram of A RECENT BONUS;  ‘Collected’ is the anagrind.  Orlando is stereotyping accountants rather unfairly here, I think: they do much more than just keep score; they have full and interesting lives.
"
346,Q:  What’s an accountant’s preferred form of contraception?, A,:  His personality.
347,Doctor in a US hospital made to jump,AMBUSH,"An insertion of MB for doctor in A US H.  Nicely misleading use of ‘jump’.
"
348,I allow small number to enter in the dark,IGNORANT,"An insertion of NO in I GRANT.
"
349,That’s French freight for a northern railway line,ANCESTRY,"It’s a great surface and clever clue, but goodness, I wouldn’t have fancied this as a beginner.  It’s an insertion of C’EST (French for ‘that’s’) in A, N for northern and RY for railway.  ‘Line’ is the definition and ‘freight’ is telling you that ANRY has to ‘carry’ C’EST.
"
350,Singer may be employed for this type of music – Enya’s first to be introduced,SEWING,"Again, this is a big ask.  You need to know that ‘Singer’ is a brand of sewing machine (our mam had one where you had to wind the wheel on the side to make it go).  SWING is a type of music and when you introduce the first letter of Enya you’ve got your answer.
"
351,My word is extremely angry!,I SAY,"!A kind of cd/dd.  *Edit: Judy gets the silver star for explaining this properly at comment no 5.*
"
352,What may be potted meat’s first eaten?  That’s elementary,GERMANIUM,"See my comment at 25 across.  GERANIUM is what may be potted; M is the first letter of ‘meat’.  If the first ‘eats’ the second you end up with the chemical element with atomic number 32.
"
353,"Ten cohorts, say, accepted by Aslan",LEGION,"I must get some new specs.  I spent far too long trying to solve this with ‘Asian’ as the final word.  It’s EG (for example, ‘say’) in LION.  Aslan is the lion in *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* by CS Lewis.  Aslan is also Jesus, according to some.
"
354,Why blood is thicker than water?,RELATIVE DENSITY,"A cd.  RELATIVE DENSITY is another term for specific gravity.
"
355,Chesterton’s father at home with good poet,BROWNING,"Father Brown is a fictional character created by G K Chesterton.  No, I hadn’t either.  Add him to IN for ‘at home’ and G for ‘good’ and you’ve got Robert BROWNING, whom I had heard of.
"
356,Adherents of religion first to leave river,INDUS,"[H]INDUS
"
357,Treatment making hotpot easy,OSTEOPATHY,"anagram of HOTPOT EASY;
"
358,Bargee whose diet was effective?,LIGHTERMAN,"First step the SOED to find out what a ‘bargee’ is.  ‘A bargeman.’   Next step: get a few crossing letters.  Final step: remember that LIGHTER is a type of barge and twig the cd.
"
359,"Glance from mixed choir, etc",RICOCHET,"anagram of CHOIR ETC;
"
360,Game theory’s first applied to town in Ireland,TENNIS,"The first letter of theory and ENNIS, the town in County Clare.
"
361,Putting name to river is futile,NO USE,"N for name plus OUSE, the river.
"
362,Clergyman not beginning soon,ANON,"[C]ANON.  The answer is an archaic or literary word for ‘soon’.
"
363,Group going across river for a meal,BRUNCH,"An insertion of R for river into BUNCH for group.
"
364,A couple watch one who’s cheating?,TWO,"-TIMERA charade of TWO and TIMER for watch.
"
365,Train isn’t fixed en route,IN TRANSIT,"anagram of TRAIN ISN’T;  The anagrind is ‘fixed’.
"
366,Artist contributing to postmodern style,ERNST,"Hidden (‘contributing to’) in postmodERN STyle.  Referring to Max Ernst, the German painter, sculptor and poet.  If it’s the first time you’ve come across him, commit him to memory, because he often comes up in crosswords.
"
367,With £25 gets into Cruft’s elaborate promotional event?,DOG,"-AND-PONY SHOW‘Pony’ is slang for £25.  If you put AND (with) and it inside DOG SHOW (Cruft’s) you’ve got your answer.  ‘An elaborate or formal occasion or display designed to attract people’s attention, esp a business briefing or sales presentation’ (SOED).  It’s shown as North American colloquialism, but I’m sure I’ve heard it over here too.
"
368,Style of interior design having red coat applied,ART DECO,"anagram of RED COAT;  ‘Applied’ is the anagrind.
"
369,Queer Street?  Phoned helpline ultimately,STRANGE,"Nicely misleading overlap of Queer and Street.  It’s a charade of ST, RANG and E as the last letter of helplinE.
"
370,Letter from European saint found in stack,EPISTLE,"Another charade: it’s E, plus an insertion of ST in PILE (stack).
"
371,Nelson’s short speech after opening of hostilities,HORATIO,"Nelson’s first name is the solution: it’s ORATIO[N] after H for ‘opening of hostilities’.
"
372,"In a city of Mesopotamia, I caught Goldfinger",AURIC,"A charade of A, UR (the setters’ favourite old city) I and C.  Auric means ‘golden’, so I guess ‘Goldfinger’ is acceptable as the definition, and it’s a good surface.  *Edit: thanks to Mystogre, who’s pointed out that Auric Goldfinger is the villain in the Bond movie.*
"
373,Demoted socialist entertaining emissary,RELEGATED,"An insertion of LEGATE in RED.
"
374,"Duke, entering a wood by canal, made a striking impression",CUT A DASH,"Nice story-telling surface.  It’s a charade of D for Duke in A ASH, preceded by CUT for canal.
"
375,Seasoning fellow very quietly put in,PEPPER,"An insertion of PP (musically very quiet) in PEER for fellow.
"
376,Blasted din ruined by appointments arranged by a third party,BLIND DATES,"anagram of BLASTED RUIN;
"
377,Revolting drunk may make one very tense,UPTIGHT,"A charade of UP and TIGHT.
"
378,Child in a new series,CHAIN,"‘Series’ is the definition, as in a series/chain of events.  It’s a charade of CH for child and anagram of IN A;
"
379,Drink in fancy hotels – sweet wine mostly,WET ONE,"’S WHISTLEanagram of HOTELS SWEET WIN;  Everyman’s using ‘mostly’ to tell you to take the last letter of ‘wine’ off before you make the anagram fodder.
"
380,"Club official, more confident after revision of 8",TREASURER,"SURER after a revision (anagram) of the solution to 8dn (RATE).  Everyman doesn’t often cross-reference clues in this way.
"
381,"Start to move on, early in the rainy season",MONSOON,"A charade of M, ON and SOON.
"
382,Consider a charge,RATE,"Our first dd.
"
383,"As prosecutor, be prepared to expose bribe",A SOP TO CERBERUS,"anagram of AS PROSECUTOR BE;  It’s a phrase I’ve learned from crosswords.  Cerberus was the tricephalic dog that guarded the entrance to Hades.  The Ancient Greeks and Romans used to bury their dead with a slice of cake as a bribe to the dog to allow safe passage of the departed.  Although if you were going to hell anyway, why would you care?  I’m not red hot on classics, so perhaps I’ve misunderstood the story.
"
384,"Have second thoughts about Conservative party referendum, primarily",RECONSIDER,"A charade of RE, CON, SIDE and R for the first letter in referendum.  I’m sure the clue’s appearance shortly after the AV referendum is serendipitous, but perhaps I’m doing the setter a disservice.
"
385,"Approach daughter, hypnotised",ENTRANCE,"A charade of ENTRANCE and D for daughter.
"
386,Trendy?  That girl must be with it to succeed,INHERIT,"A charade of IN (trendy, fashionable) HER and IT.  It’s the less common definition of ‘succeed’, in the sense of inheriting an estate when someone pops their clogs.
"
387,Swept to wild dance,TWO,"-STEPanagram of SWEPT TO;
"
388,A peculiar urge to express disagreement,ARGUE,"anagram of A URGE;
"
389,Powder kept by hospital chemist,TALC,"Hidden in hospiTAL Chemist.
"
390,"I think this is a deletion of C for ‘caught’ from BUTTERCUP, but I don’t know why.   ",E,dit: Thanks to Eileen for explaining this one – BUTTERCUP is a character from Gilbert and Sullivan’s HMS Pinafore.
391,Leaves here with a very small computer,PALMTOP,"A cd.  You would find leaves at the top of a palm tree and a palmtop is a handheld PC.  My last one in.
"
392,Deplored crude modern setting for university,MOURNED,"An insertion of U for university in anagram of MODERN;  ‘Crude’ is the anagrind and ‘setting’ is the insertion indicator.
"
393,What jewel thieves do on course to aim for perfect result,LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED,"A kind of cd/dd.  Jewel thieves might ‘turn’ their diamonds on a (presumably training) course; the definition is ‘to aim for a perfect result’.  Which is not what the expression means, in my opinion; for me it’s more to do with the thoroughness of the search.  *Edit: Thomas has the correct parsing for this at comment no 11, for which thanks.*
"
394,Native in Turkey’s elected thus,INTRINSIC,"A charade of IN, TR for Turkey, IN for elected, and SIC, the Latin word for thus. * Sic transit gloria* and all that.  It’s also ultimately the root of the word ‘si’ for ‘yes’ in a number of Romance languages, but you’ll know it best from its use when a writer wants to quote something that has a spelling or grammatical mistake in it, when it will appear in parentheses after the word in question.
"
395,Spare no expense – but path to house needs repair,PUSH THE BOAT OUT,"anagram of BUT PATH TO HOUSE;  The anagrind is ‘needs repair’.
"
396,Disaster when humour backfires,DOOM,"A reversal (‘backfires’) of MOOD.
"
397,Obscene phone call’s a bloomer,BLUEBELL,"A charade of BLUE and BELL.  ‘Bloomer’ is often used to indicate a flower.
"
398,Orders staff appointments,MANDATES,"A charade of MAN and DATES.
"
399,Bird showing speed,KNOT,"The stocky wader is also a term for speed at sea.  A dd.
"
400,Book of star signs?,AUTOGRAPH ALBUM,"A cd.
"
401,Lone chap unexpectedly on line in attempt to communicate,PHONE CALL,"anagram of LONE CHAP L;  L for line is also common.  The anagrind is ‘unexpectedly’.
"
402,Grab end of toboggan in winter sports event,LUNGE,"An insertion of N (end of toboggaN) in LUGE.  Nice surface, but again for me, LUNGE and GRAB are not the same thing.
"
403,Deprived City area regularly delays nurse,EAST END,"Hmmm.  Is the East End (of London) still deprived?  I’m a northern lad, so I can’t say.  It’s EAS (the even letters of dElAyS) and TEND for nurse.  The enumeration is given as (7), but it should surely be (3,4).  *(4,3 in fact – thanks to Pelham Barton). * You need to cross the channel to Belgium to have it as one word: OOSTENDE (from the Dutch OOST, East, and EINDE, end).
"
404,"Vainly crossing motorway after time, wanting spirit",TIMIDLY,"T for time and an insertion of MI for the M1 motorway in IDLY.  ‘Wanting spirit’ is the definition.
"
405,European election broadcast,POLE,"Clever concise cluing.  It’s a homophone clue: POLE and POLL for election sound the same; ‘broadcast’ is the homophone indicator.
"
406,Old world meeting for races covering about three miles,LEAGUE OF NATIONS,"The intergovernmental organisation that was created at the end of WW1.  A LEAGUE is around three miles, the distance that a person could walk in one hour, and ‘races’ are NATIONS.  I think the picture that Nutmeg’s trying to paint is lots of different peoples covering a distance of three miles.
"
407,Bear with canine appearance?,TEETHE,"I don’t see this.  ‘Canine appearance’ is TEETHE, but where’s the definition?  ‘Bear’ doesn’t mean TEETHE.
"
408,"Awkward situation, but parking’s easy",PLIGHT,"A charade of P for Parking and LIGHT.
"
409,Postpone dance after union’s withdrawn from opening,MOTHBALL,"A charade of MO[U]TH and BALL for dance.  Nutmeg’s asking you to withdraw the U for union from MOUTH, an opening.
"
410,Train due for overhaul had a leak,URINATED,"anagram of TRAIN DUE;  Brilliant.  ‘Overhaul’ is the anagrind.
"
411,Strike involving Catholic all-rounder on track,DECATHLETE,"An insertion (‘involving’) of CATH in DELETE, for strike (out).
"
412,Prominent part of male anatomy’s very soft in water,ADAM,"’S APPLEPuhleese!  What is it with female setters and their obsession with the male body?  We’ve got brains as well you know.  A cracking clue: it’s an insertion of PP for musically very soft, in ADAM’S ALE, a term for water.  Presumably alluding to the fact that although the Garden of Eden was bounteous, breweries hadn’t been invented back then.
"
413,Frenchman joining crew?  Rot!,GANGRENE,"A charade of GANG for crew and RENÉ (meaning ‘reborn’) for your typical Frenchman (he’s friends with Scotsman IAN and Irishman PADDY).
"
414,Ring an upper-class lady up for financial assistance,LEGAL AID,"Terrific surface.  It’s a reversal of DIAL A GEL.  Since it’s a down clue, ‘up’ is the reversal indicator.  GEL is a nod to the fact that people like the Queen would pronounce ‘girl’ as ‘gel’.  Her consort’s just announced that now he’s ninety he’ll be stepping back from public duties.  I for one have not been reaching for tissues to wipe away the lachrymation.
"
415,Grant supporting tea house in the Alps,CHALET,"A charade of CHA for tea and LET for grant.  Again, the ‘supporting’ part of the clue works because it’s a down clue.
"
416,High-level bid around middle of slow obstacle race,SLALOM,"Another clue I enjoyed.  It’s SLAM around LO: the first part is referring to the bridge term; the second part is the middle two letters of sLOw.
"
417,Girl band’s drink reduced in volume?,BEVY,"I wasn’t enamoured of this one.  Mrs Google says there is such a thing as a Y-band, but I think it’s referring to the term a BEVY of beauties.  The definition is ‘drink reduced in volume’, referencing the slang word BEVY, as in ‘let’s have a few bevvies tonight’.  My trouble with this is that I’d always spell this word for ‘beverage’ BEVVY.  The SOED supports the alternative spelling; Collins doesn’t.  *Edit: Andrew and Eileen have explained this properly in the first two comments.  Merci!*
"
418,TV comedy Addams Family’s final run?  Could be,DAD,"’S ARMYanagram of ADDAMS Y R;  The Y and the R are in the anagram fodder because Y is the last letter of familY and R for run(s) comes from cricket.  A bit of a blast from the past with both series. ‘Don’t tell him, Pike!’ and ‘You rang?’ are the quotes you’ll remember if you’re old enough.  ‘Could be’ is the anagrind.
"
419,Clubs reportedly want people who’ll give a hand for pay,CLAQUE,"Okay, I put in CLIQUE because nothing else seemed to fit, but I was wrong: the definition is ‘a hired body of applauders’, and it’s C for Clubs and a homophone of ‘lack’.  It’s from the French *claquer*, to clap, and despite speaking French I’d never come across this expression.  *Une claque* is also a word for ‘a slap’; change the gender to *un claque* and you get ‘a knocking shop’.  We’ll move on.
"
420,Skirts attempt to create government department,MINISTRY,"A charade of MINIS for short skirts and TRY.
"
421,Pinches from vulnerable in backstreet,TWEAKS,"An insertion of WEAK for vulnerable in ST (street) backwards.
"
422,"In review, “Tosca lacks middle register ultimately, Scarpia’s OK” – so very disappointed",SICK AS A PARROT,"anagram of T A R SCARPIAS OK;  The standard footballer’s response to a loss (as opposed to ‘over the moon’) is an anagram of T and A from ToscA lacking the middle, R for the last letter of registeR, and SCARPIAS OK.   I never knew that Scarpia was a character in Tosca (although he/she is a fairly regular contributor to Fifteensquared).  With the setter’s pseudonym being Klingsor, we’re not going to get an opera-free puzzle, are we?  ‘In review’ is the anagrind.
"
423,Novel’s an interminable book,ROMAN,"More French needed.  ROMAN is French for ‘novel’ in the book sense (as in *roman-à-clef*) and the solution is a shortening of ROMANCE.  This has just made me realise that while modern French has abandoned the spelling of ‘*clef*‘ in favour of ‘*clé*‘, the former spelling still exists in our borrowing.
"
424,s wife brought in to explode banger in Munich?,BRATWURST,"Liked this one.  The solution to 18dn is TRAITOR, so it’s RAT plus W for wife in BURST for explode.  And BRATWURST is a German sausage or ‘banger’.
"
425,Insufficiency as result of early winter across the pond?,SHORTFALL,"A kind of cd/play on words.  If the autumn (fall) in the USA were short, then there would be an early winter.
"
426,Quench thirstiness at last with water,SLAKE,"Great surface reading.  It’s thirstinesS plus LAKE.
"
427,High jinks on stage entertaining duke – they always get a laugh,STANDING JOKES,"anagram of JINKS ON STAGE D;  D is for duke, ‘high’ is the anagrind and ‘entertaining’ is inviting you to add D to the anagram fodder.
"
428,Make coal fire light first of all?,IGNITE,"This is based on the fact that L for light (as for example in light emitting diode, LED) when added to IGNITE for ‘fire’ makes LIGNITE, a type of coal.  But doesn’t the clue suggest that LIGNITE should be the answer?
"
429,Embezzle money previously gathered by church collection,PECULATE,"More French references: an insertion (‘gathered’) of ÉCU, an old French coin, in PLATE for the collection of money in church.
"
430,Female takes Irishman with nothing out for a drink,SHERRY,"A charade of SHE and R[O]RY.  Rory is a typically Irish male name, I suppose.
"
431,Pupils from European country second to last,ETONIANS,"Cleverly constructed.  It’s ESTONIAN for people ‘from a European country’, with the second letter S moved to be the last.  Most of the senior members of the Cabinet appear to have gone to ETON, which is worrying when you think that we’re supposed to be meritocratic.
"
432,"Following mother’s request, grew a plant",DAMASK ROSE,"A charade of DAM (mother), ASK and ROSE for ‘grew’.
"
433,Study Old English houses,DEN,"A well-disguised hidden answer: it’s in OlD ENglish and ‘houses’ is the hidden indicator.
"
434,Don’t drink liqueur without the covering “Cheers!”,ABSTAIN,"This is what I meant when I said it was in places easier to solve than parse: this is an insertion of TA! for ‘Cheers!’ in ABSIN, which is ABSINTHE, the disgusting liqueur without THE on the end.
"
435,"Doctor’s right first off, assuming Royal Society fellows may wear these",MORTARBOARDS,"I think this is a charade of MO for doctor, [S]TARBOARD (right, first letter removed) with the inclusion (‘assuming’) of R for Royal all followed by S for Society.  I think.
"
436,Unrefined Neanderthal’s characteristic,LOWBROW,"A dd.  This is perhaps a bit unfair to *Homo neanderthalensis*, which was quite an intelligent species, much more so than certain members of *Homo sapiens* that you can apparently see most weekends in Prague city centre on a stag or hen night.
"
437,"Football player from, say, West Bromwich Albion covets Keegan’s caps",QUARTERBACK,"Excellent misdirection in the clue: you need to separate out (for a football fan, difficult) West and Bromwich Albion.  The solution refers to an American football player and it’s QUARTER (West, say) and the initial letters of Bromwich Albion Covets Keegan.
"
438,"Piece of cake making you nauseous, no question",EASY,"[QU]EASY
"
439,Vehicle’s been pounded by officer with everyone detained?  It’s way over our heads,VAN ALLEN BELT,"I got this from the crossing letters, twigging the suggestion of a structure in space and remembering the term.  ‘Two regions partly surrounding the Earth containing intense radiation and high-energy charged particles’ (SOED).  But I can’t parse it for the life of me.  I see VAN for ‘vehicle’ and ALL for ‘everyone’, but beyond that* *I don’t know.  Someone will come to my rescue, no doubt.  *Edit: Eileen has – for which thanks.*
"
440,Nous sommes en Contes – half of that needs translating,COMMON SENSE,"Clever, clever, clever.  I put this in because it couldn’t be anything else, but wasn’t able to see it for ages because I couldn’t get the French reading out of my head.  The phrase means ‘We’re in Contes’ anagram of Contes is a French city/district near Nice).  But the pdm was realising that the definition is ‘nous’, and it’s (SOMMES EN CON; with ‘half of that’ indicating the CON and ‘needs translating’ being the anagrind.
"
441,"Bob, after tearing his hair out, will be so free from anxiety",STRESSLESS,"A charade of S for shilling (a bob in old money, lsd) and TRESSLESS, which is a whimsical way of saying having torn your hair out.
"
442,Judas Priest’s last tour avoids university after unending strike,TRAITOR,"‘Judas’ is the definition: the disciple who betrayed Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane for thirty pieces of silver, according to the Gospels.  It’s a charade of T for last of PriesT, TO[U]R (avoiding U for university) and RAI[D] (unending strike).  The ‘after’ in the clue gives you the order of the charade.  Again, pretty clear what the answer was from the crossing letters, but tough to parse.  Judas Priest are an English heavy metal band, btw.
"
443,Nice day?  Bring lad round to visit,SOJOURN,"More French.  It’s JOUR, for ‘day’ in Nice, France, surrounded by SON, to give you a word for visit.
"
444,"Children – that’s sons, not daughters – get smack",KISS,"A replacement of S for sons for D for daughters in KIDS, to give you a word that has the slang equivalent, ‘smack’.
"
445,Jana regularly pinches bottom of wing commander,AGA,"Lucky wing commander, as long as there’s no RAF policy on sexual harassment.  It’s AA for the even letters of Jana, with the inclusion (‘pinching’) of G for bottom of winG.  An Ottoman title for a commander, the best known of whom was the AGA KHAN.
"
446,British PM receiving a kiss from a domineering woman,BATTLE,"-AXEA charade of B for British and ATTLEE with an insertion (‘receiving’) of A X for ‘a kiss’.  Clement Attlee was the British PM in the post-war years after the Labour Party won a landslide victory over Churchill’s Conservatives.
"
447,Sensational cover capturing ancient city,LURID,"An insertion (‘capturing’) of UR, CrosswordLand’s favourite ancient city, in LID.
"
448,Does it mean brand new slots?,ONE,"-ARMED BANDITSThis is the first of the anagrams that I really liked.  It’s anagram of DOES IT MEAN BRAND; and the surface is very well-constructed. ‘New’ is the anagrind and since ‘slots’ is a slightly loose definition of ‘slot machines’, there’s a question mark at the end.  Fine clue.
"
449,Staff and non-commissioned officers in a large country house,MANOR,"Lovely surface for a simple clue: it’s a charade of MAN for  ‘staff’ in the verbal sense and OR for ‘other ranks’.
"
450,Runs from farm in a dell in flood,AVALANCHE,"Everyman’s indicating that you should remove the R from [R]ANCH and then insert it into A VALE for ‘a dell’.  It’s relying on the non-snowy definition of ‘avalanche’, as in a phrase like ‘an avalanche of criticism’.
"
451,Cause for hope in plight,PROMISE,"A dd, and a very clever one, imho.  This was my last one in, and I knew it had to be PROMISE, but it took me a while to see why.  One definition is obviously ’cause for hope’; but the other relies on the archaic meaning of ‘plight’, as heard in church wedding ceremonies.  ‘And thereto I plight thee my troth.’  Translation: ‘And so I promise you my fidelity’.  One in three marriages in the UK ends in divorce, but hey ho, we all meant it at the time …
"
452,Provokes former partner with quotes,EXCITES,"A charade of EX and CITES.
"
453,Turning device that could make you chatter,RATCHET,"anagram of CHATTER;
"
454,"Artist getting help, a struggling Italian painter",RAPHAEL,"A charade of RA for artist and anagram of HELP A;  ‘Struggling’ is the anagrind for the second part of the answer.  The painter was a contemporary of Michaelangelo and Da Vinci.
"
455,Drink drop of kirsch at party back in Virginia,VODKA,"An insertion of K for first letter of kirsch and DO for party (all reversed, ‘back’) in VA for Virginia state.
"
456,Crafty minor orders mask to bring about artful deception,SMOKE AND MIRRORS,"Another fine anagram.  I was off into Oliver Twist and Artful Dodger territory for a while, but it’s anagram of MINOR ORDERS MASK; and ‘crafty’ is the anagrind.
"
457,"In the process of looting, with place being abandoned",UNDER,"It’s [PL]UNDER, and ‘in the process of’ as in ‘in the process of construction’/’under construction’.
"
458,Those who just missed out on the gold rush?,RUNNERS,"-UPNot referring to the ’49ers but to a race or other competition where you’re competing for the gold medal.  A cd.
"
459,Bishop fell over brush,BROOM,"A charade of B for bishop and a reversal (‘over’) of MOOR for ‘fell’.
"
460,He had tender foot treated in bus terminus?,THE END OF THE ROAD,"Another clever anagram.  It’s anagram of HE HAD TENDER FOOT;  ‘Treated’ is the anagrind.
"
461,"Praise Garland, reportedly, and a broadcasting executive",LORD REITH,"A homophone clue, indicated by ‘reportedly’, of ‘laud wreath’.  LORD REITH was the founder and first Director General of the BBC, and is remembered each year through the Reith Lectures.
"
462,Mean to declare silver and lead in earrings,AVERAGE,"Plenty of misdirection here, with both ‘mean’ and ‘lead’ changing their meanings from the surface reading.  The definition is ‘mean’ and then it’s AVER, AG for ‘silver’ and E for the ‘lead’ letter in earrings.
"
463,Welcome hug,EMBRACE,"A dd.
"
464,Girl in hotel in Damascus,LINDA,"Hidden in hoteL IN DAmascus.
"
465,"Rule in hearing on domestic pets, then come down hard",RAIN CATS AND DOGS,"A charade of RAIN for a homophone (‘hearing’) of ‘reign’ and CATS AND DOGS.  This phrase is one of the mysteries of the English language, with a number of theories of where it came from, none of them conclusive.  You can ask Mrs Google if you like, but I’m not convinced by the most common explanation, which is that cats and dogs used to live under thatched roofs and would be washed down to the floor when it rained heavily.  The French have a much better expression: ‘*Il pleut comme les vaches qui pissent*‘, ‘It’s raining like cows pissing’, which you don’t need much imagination to interpret.
"
466,"Natural spread of seed is spread out on lawn, initially",DISPERSAL,"A charade of (IS SPREAD) and L for the first letter of lawn.
"
467,"Together, eccentric pair get through university",PARI PASSU,"A charade of anagram of PAIR; PASS and U. ‘With equal speed; side by side; simultaneously and equally’ (SOED).  If you’re interested, it comes from the Latin for ‘with equal step’.  And yes, I only know this from crosswords.
"
468,Always seen with daughter wearing cloak in republic,CAPE VERDE,"The archipelago in the Atlantic is an insertion (‘wearing’) of EVER and D for ‘daughter’ in CAPE.
"
469,Rough terrain for a coach,TRAINER,"Another cleverly hidden anagram.  It’s anagram of TERRAIN; and the anagrind is ‘rough’.
"
470,Most of army unit’s recommended diet,REGIMEN,"REGIMEN[t].
"
471,Weapon attracting special attention,SPEAR,"A charade of SP for ‘special’ and EAR for ‘attention’.
"
472,Storyteller can make adult sit up,AESOP,"He of the fables fame is a charade of A for ‘adult’ and ESOP for ‘pose’ or ‘sit’ reversed.  ‘Up’ is the reversal indicator since this is a down clue.
"
473,Danish king eventually supporting the necessary supporters,FORTINBRAS,"A charade of FOR (‘supporting’) TIN (money, ‘the necessary’) and BRAS (‘supporters’).  It’s ‘eventually’ because FORTINBRAS only becomes King of Denmark at the end of Shakespeare’s *Hamlet*.
"
474,Country club tolerated,CHAD,"A charade of C for club(s) and HAD for ‘tolerated’, as in ‘I’ve had it up to here’.
"
475,"Tyre setting restriction applied, chasing finishers in final race",LEBANON,"Spent ages trying to work out the ‘Tyre’ bit, but of course it’s referring to the Middle Eastern City.  So Anax is prompting you to put BAN for ‘restriction’ and ON for ‘applied’ after the finishing letters of finaL racE.
"
476,Crime starts to excite when you’re tough,SINEWY,"A charade of SIN for ‘crime’ and the starting letters of Excite When You’re.
"
477,Sex?  For rather than against going …,PROGRESS,"One of the reasons I find Anax a hard setter is that clues like this one have the definition so well disguised.  It’s ‘going’ in this case (‘when the going gets tough, the tough get going’), and is a substitution of PRO for CON in congress for ‘sex’.
"
478,hammer and tongs in the casual version of it,ONE,"-NIGHT STANDanagram of AND TONGS IN THE; with ‘hammer’ (perhaps appropriately, if you’re into urban slang) as the anagrind.  A lovely, misleading surface, continuing the sexual theme, with the ellipses for once actually connecting two related clues.  Anax is never going to get the gig setting for the *Church Times* any time soon, I fancy.
"
479,Old country wine gets Madonna tipsy,MUSCAT AND OMAN,"A charade of MUSCAT and anagram of MADONNA;
"

"
491,Process to stop kid talking,DIGEST,"The universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old today, and it would have taken me a further 13.7 billion years to see this.  So with a little help from my friends, I can tell you that it’s a homophone (‘talking’) of DIE for ‘stop’ and JEST for ‘kid’.
"
492,Scrap metal 4 presumably,ROUGH,"-AND-TUMBLEThis is one of those reverse clue thingies: an anagram (‘rough’) of METAL and BUND, the answer to 4 down.

"
498,"It’s immature and wrong, dad admits",PUPA,"It’s an insertion of UP in PA.  I couldn’t see how ‘up’ could be synonymous with ‘wrong’, but a further bit of help from my friends tells me that it’s the ‘what’s up?/what’s wrong?’ equivalence.

Where I live, the Women’s Institute fur coat and no knickers night at the village hall on the first Tuesday of every month is as exciting as it gets.
"
514,Island partial to cruciverbalism,BALI,"Hidden in cruciverBALIsm.

"
547,Joey has time for grub,ROOT,"What with 3dn and this, it’s been a grubby sort of puzzle.  It’s ‘grub’ as a verb this time and is a charade of ROO for ‘Joey’ (Australian slang for a young kangaroo) and T for ‘time’.

615,Security items pack sold irregularly,PADLOCKS,"anagram of PACK SOLD;  ‘Irregularly’ is the anagrind.
"
616,Epicure in rough sea takes the test? No way!,AESTHETE,"Probably the toughest clue.  A word for someone who enjoys the finer things in life is a charade of anagram of SEA;, THE and TE[ST].  The ‘No way!’ part of the clue is inviting you to take ST for ‘street’ or ‘way’ out of TEST.
"
617,All join in exclamation of surprise and revel in it!,WALLOW,"An insertion of ALL in WOW!
"
618,Five lie in assembly — that’s abominable!,VILE,"anagram of V LIE;  I hope I’m not the only one who messed up here by first entering EVIL.  ‘In assembly’ is the anagrind.

"
628,"Master nothing new, yet become a virtuoso",MAESTRO,"Come to think of it, I liked this one as well.  It’s anagram of MASTER O; and ‘new’ is the anagrind.
"
629,Growth of learning in the Bible,TREE OF KNOWLEDGE,"A cd.  The answer comes from Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament, and refers to the tree from which Eve took the forbidden fruit and then encouraged Adam to do the same, resulting in God banishing them both from the Garden of Eden.  And we all know what happened afterwards.  That’s women for you …
"

"
631,"Make effort, say, to damage a weapon",TRIDENT,"A charade of TRI (a homophone of TRY) and DENT for ‘damage’.  ‘Say’ is the homophone indicator.

"
635,Spooner’s reported basic disease carriers in these drinking vessels,BEER MUGS,"Just a personal thing, but I’m not a big fan of Spooner clues.  This one is pretty clear, though: the good Reverend might have said MERE BUGS for ‘basic disease carriers’.
"
636,Very eager making an attempt to get good,AGOG,"A charade of A GO and G for ‘good’.
"
637,What’s loosened from ground I dug,UNDID,"Hidden in groUND I Dug.
"
638,"Time to tuck into sticky stuff, a stew gone wrong – or let it do this?",GO TO WASTE,"Quixote’s prompting you to put T for ‘time’ into GOO, ‘sticky stuff’ and follow it up with anagram of A STEW;.  ‘Gone wrong’ is the anagrind and it’s kind of a semi &lit thingy, I suppose.  Whatever, a good clue.
"
639,Drink is sin – get reticent about that,SHERRY,"Drink is indeed sin, as attenders at S&B events know well (usually the next morning).  In this case, it’s an insertion of ERR for ‘sin’ in SHY for ‘reticent’.

"
641,"Fashionable artist – over time I’m fading away, beyond question",INCONTESTABLE,"A charade of IN for ‘fashionable’ and CONSTABLE for ‘artist’ with an insertion of TE.  The insertion indicator is ‘over’ and the TE comes from taking IM out of T[IM]E, because that’s what you’re left with if IM is ‘fading away’.
"
642,Church given a second blue fancy vestment,CHASUBLE,"Not a word you’re likely to drop into conversation down the pub tonight, but it’s a fair enough clue: a charade of CH for ‘church’, A S and anagram of BLUE;  ‘Fancy’ is the anagrind.  ‘A sleeveless vestment worn by the celebrant at the Mass or Eucharist.’  Its etymology links it back to the Latin *casa* for ‘house’, according to the SOED.  Goodness knows why.
"
643,Sailor given appropriate objective,TARGET,"A charade of TAR for ‘sailor’ and GET for ‘appropriate’ (in the sense of ‘steal’).
"
644,State control that’s loosening to become ‘semi-rigid’,DIRIGISME,"One where a bit of French would be helpful. It’s anagram of SEMI-RIGID;; ‘loosening’ is the anagrind; and *diriger* in French is ‘to lead, to direct’; *un dirigeant* is ‘a director’.  If you didn’t know French then you’d just have to slap it in once you’d got the crossing letters, or perhaps – unlike me – you just knew it.
"
645,Old vessel – hole finally let in a lot of water,OCEAN,"An insertion (‘let in’) of E for the last letter of ‘hole’ in OCAN, ‘A Phoenecian merchant ship, with masts and oars’.  Actually, I made that up.  Although that’s the kind of thing I was looking for in the dictionary, before discovering that the word doesn’t in fact exist.  It’s O for ‘old’ and CAN for ‘vessel’.  Good surface, crap initial parsing on my part.
"
646,Fuss yet to be dealt with,TO,"-DOA dd.
"
647,Your song of mourning could be rendered as ‘thy drone’,THRENODY,"anagram of THY DRONE;  ‘A song of lamentation.’

"
649,Thus night is nigh – it’ll be going on for ever,ENDLESS,"I’m afraid this is ask the audience time, because I’m not seeing this.  ‘Going on for ever’ is the definition, I presume, and if something is ‘nigh’ then it means that there’s an ‘end’ to something else.  But beyond that, *venez m’aider, s’il vous plaît*.
"
650,"Our England, a gem troubling French or Spanish, say?",MODERN LANGUAGE,"anagram of OUR ENGLAND A GEM;  ‘Troubling’ is the anagrind and *le français* and *l’espagnol* are MODERN (foreign) LANGUAGEs, or MFLs.

653,"Exceptional Christian?  Correct, one held to be unswerving",STRAIGHT,"A synonym of ‘unswerving’ is a charade of ST for ‘saint’ and an insertion of A for ‘one’ in RIGHT.  STRAIGHT has a claim to fame in our wonderful language.  Stick with me to the end of the blog and I’ll tell you why if you don’t already know.
"
654,Elation won’t be a quirky actress’s desire,I WANT TO BE ALONE,"anagram of ELATION WON’T BE A;  ‘Quirky’ is the anagrind, and it’s referring to Greta Garbo’s famous request.  Except she never actually said that.  To quote the lady herself: ‘I never said, “I want to be alone.” I only said, “I want to be left alone.” There is all the difference.’  But everyone thinks that’s what she said, so we can’t really send the setter to the naughty step on this occasion.
"
655,"Once again hire engineers, needing line repaired on street",RE,"-ENLISTAnother surface that tells you a story; this one reads very well.  ‘Once again hire’ is the definition; it’s RE for ‘Royal Engineers’, anagram of LINE; and ST.  ‘Repaired’ is the anagrind.
"
656,Young flier I discovered in covered passage beginning to tweet,AIR CADET,"Clever stuff, and I’m going to mark this down as my favourite this morning.  It’s a charade of I inserted in ARCADE (‘a covered passage’) and T for the first letter of ‘tweet’, which in this case doesn’t mean the mindless drivel that young (and actually, not so young) people put on the internet.
"
657,Affected by fire – as a Somerset town is reported to be,CHARRED,"A homophone of CHARD, population around 12,000.
"
658,"Coleridge discarding identity, morphing into painter",EL GRECO,"anagram of COLER[ID]GE;  The ID for ‘identity’ needs taking out of COLERIDGE; then it’s an anagram (‘morphing’).
"
659,"Mean one, no good, in a filthy place",STINGY,"An insertion of I for ‘one’ and NG for ‘no good’ in STY, a pig’s preferred residence (or a teenager’s, if my kids are anything to go by).

667,Denied row involved a bedcover,EIDERDOWN,"anagram of DENIED ROW;  ‘Involved’ is the anagrind.
"
668,Such as turns to and fro,ROTOR,"Unless someone has a better idea, I think this relies on the fact that a ROTOR – something that turns – is a palindrome, a word or phrase that reads the same backwards or forwards.  Was it a rat I saw?
"
669,"Hateful thing I, A. Nobel developed",OBJECTIONABLE,"A charade of OBJECT for ‘thing’ and anagram of I A NOBEL;  ‘Developed’ is the anagrind.
"
670,Foe some cavalrymen eventually repelled,ENEMY,"A hidden reversal: ‘some’ tells you to look for a hidden word in ‘cavalrYMEN Eventually and ‘repelled’ tells you to reverse it.

"
677,"Couturier isn’t rich, radio broadcast",CHRISTIAN DIOR,"Normally ‘radio’ or ‘broadcast’ would have you looking for a homophone, but here the latter is the anagrind and the former part of the anagram fodder.  It’s anagram of ISN’T RICH RADIO;
"
678,"On horseback, group brings distress",UPSET,"A charade of UP (as in ‘up in the saddle’) and SET.
"
679,ATM ready on time,CASHPOINT,"An ATM is an Automated Teller Machine.  A charade of CASH for ‘ready’ money, and POINT, one of whose definitions in the SOED is ‘A jot, a whit, a moment, an instant’.    CashPoint is a registered trademark of LloydsTSB.  Not a lot of people know that.

"
684,"A secretion troubled lad in ear, to a point",ADRENALIN,"The ‘fight or flight’ hormone is an anagram, ‘troubled’, of anagram of LAD IN EAR; and N for North, a ‘point’ of the compass.  Probably more commonly spelled ADRENALINE, but both versions are correct.
"
685,Irish writer gets great pleasure attending church,JOYCE,"The Irish author probably best known for *Ulysees* is a charade of JOY and CE.  Easy clue, but nice surface.
"
686,Stake the Spanish climbing plant,BETEL,"I entered BETAL here to start with, because I thought that it was BET for ‘stake’ and AL for a reversal of LA, the Spanish definite article, with ‘climbing’ being a reversal indicator in a down clue.  In fact it’s just a charade of BET and EL, another Spanish definite article.  Never heard of it, but as always with Everyman, it’s fairly clued.  Another good surface.
"
687,Flog Ecstasy in club,BEAT,"An insertion of E for the drug in BAT.  What did setters do before Ecstasy was invented?
"
688,Egg whisk,BOMB,"Great start to my IoS blogging career when I can’t even explain 1ac.  The nearest I can get is that an ‘egg’ can be a ‘bomb’ (ask Two Jags Prescott) and to ‘bomb’ and to ‘whisk’ are synonyms for ‘going fast’.  But I don’t really think it can be that, can it?  If it is, then it’s not my favourite ever Nitsy clue.
"
689,Determined to have pressure fixed in shower,DOWNPOUR,"An insertion of OWN for ‘have’ and P for ‘pressure’ in DOUR for ‘determined’.  Is a downpour equivalent to a shower?  That’s two quibbles in the first two clues, but I can only blog it as I see it, your honour.
"
690,Judging one’s convictions are important?,SELF,"-OPINIONATEDA cd.
"
691,Awful rant? Cool it – losing one’s voice,CONTRALTO,"Nitsy’s asking you to take the I anagram of one) out of (RANT COOL [I]T;

"
693,"Leader of extremists gave permission to capture soldiers, generating respect",ELEMENT,"A charade of E for ‘leader of extremists’ and an insertion of MEN in LET for ‘gave permission’.  However, how ‘element’ is a definition of ‘respect’, I have no idea, so would welcome a parsing from someone out there in cyberspace.
"
694,Impossible golfing position – it’s my shot by rear of tree,STYMIE,"A charade of anagram of IT’S MY; and E for the last letter of tree.  Although the word has entered the language as a synonym for ‘thwart’ or ‘frustrate’, its origins are in golf.  Yawn.

"
696,Imposing lady placing bet after party,DOWAGER,"A charade of DO and WAGER.  A DOWAGER is a widow who holds title or properties from her deceased husband, and she’s not normally from t’masses, which the ‘imposing’ is implying.
"
697,Handsome adult sitting in tree,FAIR,"A for ‘adult’ in FIR.
"
698,Having cold turkey’s fat wrapping round,STRUNG OUT,"I discovered that STRUNG OUT is a term for someone recovering from drug abuse, therefore having ‘cold turkey’.  STOUT is ‘fat’ and it’s around RUNG.  ‘Rung’ for ’round’ was a complete mystery to me, but Chambers confirms the following: RUNG, ‘a ladder round or step’; ROUND, ‘a ladder rung’.
"
699,Harsh note from son on pipe destroyed character,POISON,"-PEN LETTERA charade of anagram of SON ON PIPE; and LETTER.  ‘Destroyed’ is the ~~~~anagrind.
"
700,Intelligence error initially ignored by Foreign Office,INFO,"[S]IN plus FO.
"
701,Where you might find flat fish caught and almost abandoned,BASS CLEF,"I started the across clues with a bit of a hmmm, but the first down clue has a great surface and a lovely piece of misdirection.  Separating out the ‘flat’ and the ‘fish’ is the key to solving the clue: it’s BASS for the ‘fish’ added to C for ‘caught’ in cricket and LEF[T] for almost ‘abandoned’.  And of course the BASS CLEF is (along with the treble clef) where you would find a ‘flat’, a note lowered by a semitone.
"
702,"Adam finally alone, wickedly plucking a fruit",MELON,"The removals lorry has been busy in this puzzle: it’s a charade of M for the last letter of Adam, and anagram of [A]LONE;  ‘Wickedly’ is the anagrind and ‘plucking a’ is the removal indicator.  It’s another really good story-telling clue, though, so I’m going for this as my COD.
"
703,Threatening – nothing less – without oxygen?,OMINOUS,"A charade of O for ‘nothing’ and MINUS for ‘less’ outside O for the element with atomic number 8.  ‘Without’ means ‘outside’, as an antonym of ‘within’, although setters also use it to indicate that you should remove a letter.
"
704,"Annoyed with almost dire news, “sexed up” for short-lived excitement?",NINE,"-DAYS WONDERanagram of ANNOYED DIR]E] NEWS;  The ‘almost’ is nudging you to take the last letter from DIR[E] and ‘sexed-up’ is the anagrind.  This phrase famously entered the language in a big way when the BBC’s Andrew Gilligan reported on the BBC *Today* programme, at just after six o’clock one morning in the summer of 2003, that the government had ‘sexed up’ the dossier which indicated that Saddam Hussein had access to weapons of mass destruction which could reach the UK within 45 minutes.  There were a few repercussions if you remember.
"
705,Leaving work to whinge about head of newspaper,ON THE WING,"The definition is ‘leaving’ and it’s anagram of TO WHINGE N;  ‘Work’ is the anagrind and N is in the anagram fodder because it’s the first letter of ‘newspaper’.
"
706,Coarse fish with no tail on bottom of lake, RUDE,"The rudd is a fish; remove its tail and you’ve got RUD; add E for the bottom of lakE and you’ve got a word for ‘coarse’.  Cleverly-constructed surface.

"
708,Learn about international motorway length – it could well be boring,GIMLET,"GET for ‘learn’ around IML gives you a tool for boring holes.
"
709,"For example, ordinary daffy.  Narcissus was one",EGOMANIAC,"Narcissus was the youth who admired himself in the water too much, giving us the adjective ‘narcissistic’.  Whether this is the same thing as egomaniacal is another question (my answer would be no).  Whatever, it’s EG for ‘for example’ added to O for ‘ordinary’, as in O-levels, and MANIAC for ‘daffy’.  Narcissus is also the latin name for ‘daffodil’, so Nitsy is trying for a piece of misdirection with this.
"
710,"It’s full of melodic sounds, beginnings of ornothological ramble – and it’s fresh air too",ORATORIO,"The first two letters of ‘ornothological ramble’ added to anagram of AIR TOO;  give you your answer.  ‘Fresh’ is the anagrind.
"
711,Rubbish Pat’s put in brown cleaning receptacle,DUSTPAN,"An insertion of anagram of PATS; in DUN for a shade of brown.  ‘Rubbish’ is the anagrind.
"
712,Bottle opener for drinks attached to a belt,DARING,"‘Bottle’ is a noun here.  D for the first letter of ‘drinks’ and A RING for ‘a belt’.
"
713,Temper – losing head regularly,OFTEN,"[S]OFTEN
"
714,Ran over reckless pedestrians,SPED,"A synonym for ‘ran’ is included in recklesS PEDestrians.  Is ‘over’ a reasonable inclusion indicator?

718,After an interval promise to protect 50 developing nations,THIRD WORLD,"A charade of THIRD and an insertion of L in WORD.  The ‘interval’ is a musical one (a major or minor third) and L is the Roman numeral for fifty.
"
719,Character in Greek mythology taking back Egyptian port,ZEUS,"A reversal of SUEZ.
"
720,A cordial monk,BENEDICTINE,"A dd.  I raised an eyebrow a nanometre or two at first, since for me ‘cordial’ is a soft drink, which Bénédictine clearly isn’t.  But the SOED gives ‘a medicine, food or drink to stimulate the circulation and invigorate’, which Bénédictine clearly is.  Burnley Miners’ Club is the biggest single consumer of the liqueur.  You learn some stuff from t’Internet, don’t you?
"
721,Administrator’s routine is to play hangman,EXECUTIONER,"A charade of EXEC and anagram of ROUTINE;  ‘Is to play’ is the anagrind.
"
722,Sharp cry,KEEN,"A dd.

726,Part of foothold’s terribly crumbly,OLDSTER,"****Hidden in foothOLDS TERribly.  ‘Crumbly: a person considered very old or senile, esp by teenagers.’  That’d be me then, according to mine.
"
727,Erasmus dressed up in rubber,MASSEUR,"Please.  I’m sure the classical scholar would never have dreamt of such a thing.  Although he was a Catholic priest of course …  It’s anagram of ERASMUS;  and ‘dressed up’ is the anagrind.
"
728,Demands and gets precise amount of old money,EXACTS,"A charade of EXACT for ‘precise’ and S for ‘shilling’, which was old money before decimalisation in 1971.
"

"
732,Eccentric Lib Dem won southwest London constituency,WIMBLEDON,"anagram of LIB DEM WON;  ‘Eccentric’ is the anagrind.  I don’t think ‘Lib Dem won’ will be in many headlines come the next election somehow.

733,Ruin a French party,UNDO,"A simple charade of UN for one of the indefinite articles in French and DO for ‘party’.
"
734,Finally informed European Commission about coal mine that is crumbling,DECREPIT,"I’m going for this as my favourite today because of its lovely surface.  It’s D for the final letter of informeD, EC, RE for ‘about’ and PIT for ‘mine’.
"
735,SAS tried frantically to provide cover for debacle,DISASTER,"anagram of SAS TRIED;  ‘Frantically’ is the anagrind, but I’m not sure what the ‘cover for’ part of the clue is doing.
"
736,"I scour URLs, which could be interpreted as defamatory",SCURRILOUS,"anagram of I SCOUR URLS;  ‘Interpreted’ is the anagrind.
"
737,Be close to someone on Ramsay Street?,NEIGHBOUR,"A kind of cd.  Although I’ve never watched it, the soap ‘Neighbours’ is set in Ramsay Street.  Don’t know how I knew that.
"
738,Quiet cry followed by a surprising noise during children’s game,PEEKABOO,"Another nicely constructed clue.  P for musically quiet is followed by EEK! and A BOO!
"
739,Late December got milder,DECEASED,"A charade of DEC and EASED.
"
740,Useless series of books that’s about a sailor,OTIOSE,"Possibly the least common word in the puzzle, but Arachne’s clued it pretty clearly: it’s OT for Old Testament and an insertion of OS for ‘ordinary seaman’ in IE for *id est*, ‘that is’.
"
741,Merchant has traditional sovereign,TRADER,"A charade of TRAD for ‘traditional’ and ER for *Elizabeth Regina*, our current sovereign, lovingly known as Brenda in Private Eye.
"
742,Worships Almighty without devotional words,PSALM,"Hidden in worshiPS ALMighty.
"
743,Articulate wrong tense,TAUT,"Last clue, and my last one in.  The crossing letters weren’t megahelpful ones, and I got fixated on the final T being the ‘tense’ bit.  But it’s a homophone of TORT for ‘wrong’; ‘articulate’ is the homophone indicator.
"
744,Agent with somewhere to live – flipping smart,DAPPER,"A reversal (‘flipping’) of REP and PAD.
"
745,African city family has hidden in South Africa,KINSHASA,"‘Family’ usually leads to ‘clan’ or ‘kin’ and here it’s the latter.  It’s a charade of KIN and S(HAS)A.  ‘Hidden’ is telling you to put the HAS in SA for South Africa.

748,Head of government permits facility for capital punishment,GALLOWS,"A simple charade of G and ALLOWS.
"
749,Poet of unusual delicacy with line – awfully wise too,CECIL DAY LEWIS,"anagram of DELICACY L; anagram of WISE;  Two anagrinds: ‘unusual’ and ‘awfully’.   There’s a link here with 15dn (unintentional on the setter’s part, I’m sure).
"
750,"See bread go bad and lie about, but it’s unlikely to cause environmental pollution?",BIODEGRADABLE,"anagram of BREAD GO BAD LIE;  ‘About’ is the anagrind.
"
751,One who has an understanding of vision is brought in by old religious group,OCULIST,"Another word for ‘optician’ is an insertion of IS in O CULT.
"
752,"Just Henry in charge, with others all around",ETHICAL,"I really liked this one: it’s H IC for ‘Henry in charge’ inserted in ET AL for ‘others’ (*et alia*).  We haven’t had long to wait for this answer to make a reappearance: just last Friday, Phi had ‘Just one sign of inebriation and everyone else comes round’.  Spooky.

"
754,"Vehicle caught by sailor going to port, allowed to go on afterwards",CABRIOLET,"A charade of C for ‘caught’, AB for ‘sailor’, RIO for the setters’ favourite port, and LET for ‘allowed’.

756,Awkward moment in second year,STICKY,"Another insertion: of TICK for ‘moment’, as in ‘just a tick’, in SY for abbreviations for ‘second’ and ‘year’.
"
757,Disco’s beginning – is essay put off?,DISTRACT,"A charade of D for the first letter of ‘disco’, IS and TRACT for ‘essay’.
"
758,Small piece of art has incorporated final material,PLASTIC,"More insertion: it’s LAST for ‘final’ in PIC for an abbreviation of ‘picture’, which would be a ‘small piece of art’.
"
759,Man exploiting variations in novel garden,ELGAR,"Hidden in novEL GARden.  Edward Elgar, perhaps most famous for his Enigma Variations (including Nimrod, who – in his cruciverbal reincarnation – roughs us up in the Indy once a month).
"
760,"Rue girl going astray having got braver after suffering upset, say",IRREGULAR VERB,"Definitely my clue of the day.  I guessed that it was IRREGULAR something, but couldn’t see the answer for ages.  It’s another double anagrind: ‘going astray’ and ‘after suffering’.  The anagram fodder is anagram of RUE GIRL; and anagram of BRAVER; and the definition is ‘upset’, as an example (‘say’) of an IRREGULAR VERB.  Most English verbs are regular, and follow rules like putting -ed on the end to make the past tense and the past participle: *I walk, I walked, I have walked*.  But some verbs are irregular, and don’t follow those rules. ‘Upset’, like the verb it’s derived from, ‘set’, is one of them, since it has an unchanged past tense and past participle.  If I write ‘I upset Quixote with my blog’, you don’t know whether I’m doing it now (present tense) or did it last week (past tense). Neither, I hope.  ‘Set’, by the way, is the verb/noun/adjective with the longest entry in the OED – approximately 60,000 words, which is the length of a short novel.
"
761,"Believed to be in holiday peninsula, having taken let",SWALLOWED,"A charade of SW, for ‘south-west’, a peninsula on which many holiday in the UK, and ALLOWED for ‘let’ (another irregular verb that has an unchanged past tense).
"
762,"Needing a little time to get excited, not completely passionate",AMOROUS,"A charade of A, MO (‘a little time’) and ROUS[E].  A clue which is a shade risqué for a Monday morning, if you ask me …
"
763,Antagonistic when state is based on most prosperous region?,AVERSE,"A balanced puzzle: we’ve had the south-west and now we’ve moved to the south-east.  A charade of AVER for ‘state’ and SE for the Independent Republic of the South-East of England, where all the rich folk live.  It’s grim oop north …
"
764,Article with a picture about central characters in Health concerned with the healing process,THERAPEUTICAL,"Another good’un.  It’s a charade of THE for ‘article’ and AL for the middle characters in heALth, around anagram of A PICTURE;.  A multi-faceted clue, but you can’t say you haven’t been pointed clearly in the right direction, with ‘about’ being the anagrind.
"
765,Intense enthusiasm is lacking in lazy Tories possibly,ZEALOTRY,"anagram of LAZY TOR[I]E[S];  ‘Possibly’ is the anagrind.

766,Hostile delivery made by big fellow at front door?,BOUNCER,"A dd.  Cricket and nightclubs.
"
767,Rural form of transport inadequate – a pain,BUCOLIC,"An adjective describing the countryside is a charade of BU[S] and COLIC, the tummy pain which babies get that prevents new parents from getting any sleep.
"
768,"Laboured on behalf of church, then died",FORCED,"A charade of FOR (‘on behalf of’), CE for ‘church’ and D for ‘died’.  Are ‘forced’ and ‘laboured’ synonymous?  The point was forced/the point was laboured, I suppose.
"

"
770,Girl involves most of cast in stitch up,SUTURE,"SUE is the girl, and TUR for most of TURN, or ‘cast’, is the insertion.  ‘Turn’ and ‘cast’ are pretty remote synonyms, aren’t they?
"
771,Unfriendly measures lead to loss of confidence,COLD FEET,"A charade of COLD for ‘unfriendly’ and FEET for ‘measures’.
"
772,Article on King George taking drugs reportedly intended to create understanding,AGREEMENT,"A multi-part, but clearly indicated, charade: it’s A for ‘article’ plus GR for ‘George Rex’ plus EE for two doses of Ecstasy plus MENT for a homophone (‘reportedly’) of ‘meant’.
"
773,Scrap books returned to collection earlier,SET,"-TONice surface; hard clue imho, despite the unusual enumeration, with the key being to separate out the first two words of the clue.  The definition is ‘scrap’ in the sense of ‘fight’ and it’s TO for OT (Old Testament) reversed after SET for ‘collection’.
"
774,Bottom’s dog,TAIL,"No Shakespearean weavers this morning.  A dd, with the nounal and verbal senses of ‘tail’ in evidence.
"
775,It’s lawful to run away with a friend,LEGITIMATE,"I’m sure it’s been done before, but I liked this one lots.  A charade of LEG IT for ‘run away’ and I MATE for ‘a friend’.

"
777,Hard to get Mark to church,SCARCE,"A charade of SCAR for ‘mark’ and CE for ‘church’.  If something’s ‘hard to get’, it’s SCARCE.
"
778,Slacken by end of race after initially running a fast time,RELENT,"‘Slacken’ is the definition; it’s LENT for ‘a fast time’ after R for the first letter of ‘running’ and E for the last letter of ‘race’.  Excellent surface reading.
"
779,Everyone is in favour of this form of transport,BALLOON,"This is an insertion (‘in’) of ALL for ‘everyone’ in BOON for ‘favour’.  I think.
"
780,Fickle Conservative spotted in a moment,INCONSTANT,"I put in TRANSITORY initially, for no good reason other than ‘Conservative’ triggered the TORY bit.  That was pants, of course: it’s CON in INSTANT.
"
781,Essential to curb earl’s support,BEAR,"Hidden in curB EARl’s.  ‘Essential’ is telling you that it’s in the middle of the two words.
"
782,It’s a code word for ‘excellent’,BRAVO,"For me a ‘hmmm’ clue.  BRAVO is the word in the phonetic alphabet to indicate the letter B; and ‘Bravo!’ means ‘Well done!’, or (I suppose) ‘Excellent!’  An exclamation mark in the clue might have made it a bit more apparent.
"
783,Cover for the retired,NIGHTGOWN,"When I had a couple of crossing letters I confidently slapped in EIDERDOWN.  Which meant I was knackered in the SE corner for a bit.  It’s a cd.
"
784,A number refuse to accept protecting the Head of Charterhouse shows bias,TENDENCY,"A charade of TEN, plus an insertion of C for the first letter of Charterhouse in DENY for ‘refuse to accept’.  Jeremy Paxman is one of the public school’s alumni.  I always had him down as a grammar school boy made good, but evidently not.

"
787,Miner injured in gallery gets cut off,TERMINATE,"An insertion of anagram of MINER; in TATE, the well-known cruciverbal gallery.
"
788,Revolutionary bishop ejected from dance,REEL,"Poins is asking you to remove B for ‘bishop’ from REBEL, to leave you with the (mainly Scottish) dance.  My only problem with clues like this one is that it works just as well the other way round: I spent some time trying to find a word for ‘revolutionary’ by taking B out of a type of dance.
"
789,University model suitable to be assimilated by large business organisations,OUTFITS,"I sussed the OUT???S bit quickly, but took some time to get to the final answer.  It’s an insertion of U for ‘university’, T for ‘model’ T Ford and FIT for ‘suitable’ in OS, ‘outsize’, for ‘large’.
"
790,Disgraceful when Dicky spied on a cabinet minister,DESPICABLE,"A charade of anagram of SPIED; and CABLE.  ‘Dicky’ is the anagrind and John Vincent CABLE is the cabinet minister.  He is a grammar school boy made good.
"
791,It’s not strictly necessary for a spear-carrier,EXTRA,"A dd.  The clue relies on two definitions of EXTRA, the second being the film-related one, where people with no acting talent get the gig for standing around for hours before appearing for three seconds in a major movie. I presumed ‘spear-carrier’ referred to epics like Ben-Hur where they needed lots of extras, but on checking I find it’s a term for ‘a minor acting part’.
"
792,Story broadcast about English commune,TROYES,"The French commune is the capital of the département of Aube as well as being anagram of STORY E;  ‘Broadcast’ is the anagrind.
"
793,Soldiers carrying spades seen by girl’s grave,SEVERE,"Since it’s a down clue, this is RE for Royal Engineers or ‘soldiers’ carrying S for ‘spades’ and EVE for ‘girl’.
"
794,Sort of animal pit discovered after a time,PIGEONHOLE,"I struggled to get this, and when I had some crossing letters, resorted to a wordsearch and entered HIBERNACLE, ‘a place where an animal hibernates’, since ‘pit’ is ‘bed’.  That has naff all to do with the subsidiary indication, of course: in fact it’s PIG for ‘animal’, HOLE for ‘pit’ with the insertion of EON for ‘time’.  My feeble excuse is that I’d write PIGEON-HOLE with a hyphen, so the enumeration put me off …
"
795,Stop working when circus employee catches nasty dose,CLOSE DOWN,"An insertion of anagram of DOSE; in CLOWN.  ‘Nasty’ is the anagrind.
"
796,Managed to get extremely competitive after hospital department’s opening,ENTRANCE,"Fine surface.  ENT is the hospital Ear, Nose and Throat department; then you’ve got RAN for ‘managed’ and CE for the first and last letters of ‘competitive’.

"
799,It’s no longer needed to complete a sentence,GIBBET,"A cd, but not a great one in my opinion.  We might have given up on hanging as a form of capital punishment in this country, but there’s still plenty of it going on elsewhere.

"
801,Desire causes a fascinating woman to lose her head,ITCH,"[W]ITCH
"
802,Two-thirds of the planet in recession including posh little nation,NAURU,"One of the reasons I found this hard is that there’s a bit going on in many of the clues.  Here Punk’s asking you to choose a planet, and put U for ‘posh’ in a reversal of URAN for two-thirds of URANUS, the seventh rock from the Sun.  The answer is the tiny South Pacific nation which early British visitors called Pleasant Island.
"
803,"Someone unable to speak, one runs, seeing killer at sea",HARPOONER,"Ditto.  HARPO is the member of the Marx Brothers who never spoke; add ONE and R for runs in cricket, and you’ve got someone who’s not a whale’s best friend.
"
804,Such histrionics died in recollection of part secured by papa’s partner,MELODRAMA,"Punk’s often tricky, but very seldom inaccurate in his cluing.  This is an insertion of D for ‘died’ in a reversal of ROLE for ‘part’ in MAMA, who’s papa’s partner.
"
805,Unknown character behind individual in snack attack,BLITZ,"Less keen on this one.  Z is the ‘unknown’; before that you have I for ‘individual’ in BLT for ‘snack’.  Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato sandwich, since you ask.  Is that a good definition of ‘snack’?  Your call.
"
806,No-nonsense tarot card’s acceptance,TAKING,"Take the ROT for ‘nonsense’ out of TAROT and add KING for ‘card’.
"
807,Phosphorous spreading on the field,PLAYING,"The first of the gateway clues.  P for the chemical element and LAYING for ‘spreading’.
"
808,Termed a sort of iron-rich item,RED MEAT,"anagram of TERMED A;  RED MEAT is rich in iron and ‘sort’ is the anagrind.
"
809,"dn  One 15 24 33, one charging by the session",SITTING BULL,"A charade of SITTING for ‘session’ and BULL for ‘one charging’.  The ‘by’ doesn’t really indicate which order they’re in, so you needed some crossing letters.
"
810,"Sadness with it, a drunk stealing kiss, a fair chance disorderly",AT SIXES AND SEVENS,"Our second gateway clue.  anagram of SADNESS IT A; with X for ‘kiss’ included, EVENS for ‘fair chance’, and ‘drunk’ as the anagrind.
"
811,Riddle – it may be black or white,PEPPER,"A dd.
"
812,"Surrey town, say, served with 18",EGHAM,"A charade of EG for ‘say’ and HAM for a type of red (?) meat, the answer to 18ac.
"
813,"Setter managed to bite neck, a painful one 15 24 33",SUNDANCE KID,"Another cowboy, partner of Butch Cassidy.  In my opinion, this is one where anagram of unlike me) you’d need to know what the theme was, see the answer, and parse it afterwards.  It’s (I think) SUN for ‘setter’ and DID for ‘managed’ to include (‘bite’) (NECK A;, with ‘painful’ as the anagrind.
"
814,Skin cold – then what one might apply?,CHEAT,"A charade of C for ‘cold’ and HEAT.  It’s ‘skin’ in the sense of cheating or doing someone.
"
815,"Lacking any vision, outrageous male appearing as drag queen?",DREAMLESS,"I was hoping this would come to me when writing up the blog, and it has.  It’s anagram of MALE; in DRESS.  ‘Outrageous’ is the anagrind and if a man were ‘in dress’, he might be a drag queen.
"
816,"Amateurish, reluctant to be punched by body of fighters",COWBOY,"Here’s our six.  ‘Amateurish’ is the definition.  ‘Reluctant’ is COY; ‘to be punched by’ indicates an insertion (I think); and WBO is the World Boxing Organisation, which represents pugilists.
"
817,National support raised through drinks supplier,INDIAN,"Here’s our seven.  Not a giveaway either.  It’s a reversal of AID for ‘support’ in INN for ‘drinks supplier’.
"
818,"ac  One 15 24 33, or he’s 24 33?",CRAZY HORSE,"My first one in.  Another 7dn is an anagram (AT SIXES AND SEVENS) of ‘or he’s’.  CRAZY is the anagrind and it’s one of those reverse anagram thingummybobs.
"
819,Wildebeest’s twisted tail – or arm,GUN,"This was in fact my first one in.  GNU is a wildebeest; twist its last two letters and you’ve got GUN for ‘arm’.
"
820,One going downhill describing fluctuating rate that’s less consistent,STREAKIER,"An insertion of anagram of RATE; in SKIER.  ‘Fluctuating’ is the anagrind.
"
821,"She’s reigned for nearly 60 years, a long period",ERA,"A charade of ER for *Elizabeth Regina* and A.  There’s some celebration coming up soon, apparently.  Get the bunting out.
"
822,"Item for the range, perhaps, range perhaps for 14, perhaps",TEENAGER,"Perhaps this is TEE anagram of an item for the golf range) plus (RANGE; and is a definition of 14dn, KID.  At least it’s not anagram of GREEN TEA; or anagram of GENERATE;
"
823,Monkey cuddled by chimpanzee,IMP,"I entered PAN intially, because PAN is the genus to which chimpanzees belong: *Pan troglodytes* is the common chimpanzee, and I thought I was being clever.  I wasn’t.  It’s hidden in chIMPanzee.
"
824,"One 15 44 33, he’s called for the high jump?",GERONIMO,"A 7dn, and it’s what’s said when people go to jump off something.  Its origin is available on the Internet if you wish to go and search for it.  But don’t believe everything you read on the Internet.
"
825,Flag carries promotion for lecture,TIRADE,"An insertion (‘carries’) of AD in TIRE for ‘flag’.
"
826,Nice summer in Africa getting half cut – it’s the cold drink,ICE TEA,"An insertion of ÉTÉ for the French word for ‘summer’ (which they’d say in Nice) in ICA, which is ‘Africa’ getting cut in half.  I did say this was a hard one.
"
827,Low profile ultimately kept by him,CHEAP,"The definition is ‘low’, as in ‘that was a cheap blow’.  The last letter of profilE needs to go in CHAP.
"
828,Endlessly drunk and endlessly sexy part of London,SOHO,"SO[T] plus HO[T].
"
829,Significant comedian around the South,COSMIC,"An insertion of S for South in COMIC.  ‘Significant’ might not be my first choice of synonym for ‘cosmic’, and ‘comic’ and ‘comedian’ are pretty close, but it’s very rarely that you get to quibble about an Everyman clue, so I might as well get that out of the way in 1 Across.
"
830,Stumped by foundation garment? I don’t believe it!,STROLL ON,"!A rather old-fashioned term to express disbelief is a charade of ST for ‘stumped’ in cricket and ROLL-ON for a type of girdle.  I think they’re a bit old-fashioned too, but I’m no expert, obviously.
"
831,Stupid rioter in Pennsylvania capital,PRETORIA,"An insertion of anagram of RIOTER; in PA for one of the three capitals of South Africa (the others are Cape Town and Bloemfontein).  Executive capital, legislative capital and judicial capital respectively.  ‘Stupid’ is the anagrind.

835,"Church book in Latin, Pete translated",PENITENTIAL,"anagram of IN LATIN PETE;  ‘A book containing in codified form the canons of the Church’ (SOED).  Another one I hadn’t heard of, although again it’s very clearly clued, with ‘translated’ as the anagrind.  Anyway, that’s what crossing letters are for.

836,Sovereign measure,RULER,"A dd.
"
837,Show violence towards powerful member,STRONG,"-ARMIt’s the verbal form of the term and is a simple charade of STRONG and ARM for ‘member’.

"
839,Boy arrived a moment ago?,JUSTIN,"A cd.  If something’s JUST IN, it’s just arrived.
"
840,Smashed old bust on the rocks,BANKRUPT,"Well, I don’t rightly know what’s cracking off here.  My best guess is as follows: ‘on the rocks’ is a clear definition for BANKRUPT; ‘rupt’ is archaic for ‘bust’, according to the SOED; but where the ‘smashed’ bit comes in, I can’t explain, since I don’t see how it equals BANK.  Anyone got a better idea?
"
841,I rowed out to identify queer fish,WEIRDO,"anagram of I ROWED;  ‘Out’ is the anagrind.
"
842,Girl left in vehicle is as upset,CLARISSA,"A charade of L for ‘left’ inserted into CAR, then IS, then AS inverted, or ‘upset’.

846,Rope shown in a trial that’s fixed,LARIAT,"anagram of A TRIAL;  ‘Fixed’ is the anagrind.
"
847,Net lay spread out nicely,NEATLY,"anagram of NET LAY;  ‘Spread out’ is the anagrind.
"
848,"Runway – one’s seen between flights, ahead of take off",LANDING STRIP,"Lovely surface.  A LANDING is what you’d see between flights of stairs; if you take your clothes off, you STRIP.
"
849,People of the highest standing put up prize trophy,TOP DRAWER,"Since this is a down clue, ‘put up’ is Everyman’s way of telling you to reverse REWARD POT.  POT is in the sense of the money that accumulates in a game like poker.

"
852,Rep refurbished marvellous dwelling,PREFAB,"anagram of REP; plus FAB for the slightly dated abbreviation for ‘fabulous’ or ‘marvellous’ gives you the word for the type of house that had its heyday in the UK just after the Second World War (although there are still a few out there today).  It’s a shortened version of PREFABRICATED.  ‘Refurbished’ is the anagrind.
"
853,German boy turned up at home with an old British coin,FLORIN,"A reversal of ROLF for a German boy and IN for ‘at home’.  The coin known to people of my advanced age as a ‘two-bob bit’.
"
854,Navy going on river is pointless,NO USE,"A charade of N and OUSE, for any of several rivers in England.  Some folk don’t like N for ‘navy’, but RN is Royal Navy, so it’ll do for me.  The etymology of OUSE is interesting: it apparently comes from the Celtic word ‘Usa’, for ‘water’.  Very few words of Celtic origin have survived into Modern English, but AVON for ‘river’ is another one: the Welsh word for river is ‘afon’, but the ‘f’ is pronounced as a ‘v’.
"
855,Someone silly holding group’s valued possessions,ASSETS,"An insertion of SET for ‘group’ in ASS for ‘someone silly’.
"
856,"It’s going against the grain to be angry, not completely adorable",CROSSCUT,"It took me ages to see this, although Quixote might as well have handed it over to me as a present, with a ribbon tied round it and the answer written on the label.  CROSS is ‘angry’ and CUT[E] is ‘not completely adorable’.
"
857,Veteran sometimes pockets money from reluctant donor,RANSOM,"This was my favourite today.  A really clever hidden answer: it’s in veteRAN SOMetimes.
"
858,Bowl over lobby?,ENTRANCE,"A dd.
"

"
860,The eye’s twitching after work,OPTIC,"A charade of OP for opus or ‘work’ before TIC for ‘twitching’.
"
861,New York’s first huge temptation?,THE BIG APPLE,"The surface reading might lead you to BAGEL WITH CREAM CHEESE (although that clearly wouldn’t fit) but it’s a cd.  New York is known as THE BIG APPLE, and in the creation story in Genesis (Ch3, v4), the serpent egged on Eve to give Adam the fruit of the ‘tree that gives knowledge’, which she did; and the rest is history, as they say.  ‘Forbidden fruit’ is in the language today.  But an apple isn’t actually mentioned in Genesis, so where that comes from I don’t know.  Why New York is called THE BIG APPLE is also a bit of a dispute.
"
862,Policeman accompanying President at night to give a sort of hand,COPPERPLATE,"It’s the handwriting sort of hand.  A charade of COPPER, P for ‘president’ and LATE for ‘at night’.
"
863,Wants to sound offhand,LACKS,"A homophone of ‘lax’ for ‘offhand’.  I don’t think we’ll be getting into ‘it doesn’t sound like that where I come from’ territory today.
"
864,"Rich person displaying heavenly body, Conservative scoundrel",PLUTOCRAT,"A charade of PLUTO, the outermost (and disputed) planet, C for ‘Conservative’ and RAT for ‘scoundrel’.
"
865,Butter – any said to be cheap?,TWOPENNY,"I was into goat territory from the start, since ‘butter’ as the stuff you spread on your toast of a morning doesn’t have many synonyms, but it took me a good few crossing letters to see what it was.  It’s a homophone (‘said’) of ‘tup’ and ‘any’, because English being a stupidly non-phonetic language, that’s how we pronounce TWOPENNY, which is an adjective attributed to things that are ‘paltry, trifling, worthless’ (SOED).  And for newer solvers, ‘butter’ is reference to the fact that when goats are having a bad hair day, they butt you, so are ‘butters’.
"
866,Child unwell needs one sort of powder,CHILLI,"A charade of CH for ‘child’, ILL for ‘unwell’ and I for ‘one’ for the powder you stick in your Chilli con Carne.
"
867,Electrical device dispersing rioters outside front of shop,RESISTOR,"anagram of RIOTERS; with an insertion of S for ‘front of shop’.  Take your pick where you put the S in.  ‘Dispersing’ is the anagrind.

"
869,"A little female, Sally, becoming panicky",AFRAID,"A charade of A, F and RAID for ‘sally’.

870,Some chosen at Exeter for the governing body,SENATE,"Hidden in choSEN AT Exeter.
"
871,The sort of insensitivity that Chairman Mao was not noted for?,THOUGHTLESSNESS,"A cd, since *The Thought of Mao Tse-Tung* was widely published.
"
872,Even a king may be upset by this queen,RANEE,"I’d vaguely heard of this, but even with all the crossing letters in, I was unsure.  ‘A Hindu queen; a raja’s wife or widow.’  It’s a variant of RANI and is a reversal of E’EN, an archaic or poetic word for ‘even’, A and R for ‘king’ or Rex.
"
873,One woman helping another with problem makes guest room rather messy,SURROGATE MOTHER,"anagram of GUEST ROOM RATHER;  ‘Makes messy’ is the anagrind.

874,Monument not cheap to get repaired,CENOTAPH,"anagram of NOT CHEAP;  ‘To get repaired’ is the anagrind.
"
875,Fish that’s right for eating put on Queen’s platter,TRENCHER,"An insertion of R for ‘right’ in TENCH for fish, then ER for ‘Queen’ gives you ‘a flat piece of wood for cutting or serving meat’.  ‘That’s’ is ‘that has’, which indicates the insertion.
"
876,Prepare to become friends again,MAKE UP,"A dd.
"
877,Artist tours with police regularly coming out,SCULPTOR,"The definition is ‘artist’.  It’s anagram of TOURS PLC; for an anagram, ‘coming out’ of TOURS and PLC, which is ‘PoLiCe’ regularly.
"
878,"False copies – forged, useless",SPECIOUS,"A word that means ‘false’ is a charade of anagram of COPIES; and US for ‘useless’.  ‘Forged’ is the anagrind.
"
879,A jolly lot allow to be in a sort of band,ARMLET,"A charade of A RM and LET to give you something that you wear round your arm.  ‘Jolly’ is a term for a Royal Marine or RM.

882,"At the end, notes provided by company lawyer from New York",CODA,"Coda in musical terminology refers to the last sequence, or notes, of a piece of music; if you start with CO for ‘company’ and finish with DA for ‘District Attorney’, who would be an American lawyer, then you’ve got your answer.
"
883,Sequence from mournful tragedy lacking moderation,ULTRA,"Hidden in mournfUL TRAgedy.
"
884,Daring pull back succeeded,GUTS,"Well, here’s the football surface.  This was definitely in my second half, even when I’d got the crossing letters.  ‘Daring’ is the definition and it’s GUT for ‘tug’ or ‘pull’ backwards and S for ‘succeeded’.
"
885,in grass meadow,HAYLEY,"The first of our bonnie lasses.  A charade of HAY for ‘grass’ and LEY for ‘meadow’.  More commonly spelled LEA, but both are in dictionaries.  The village where I live, like lots of others, ends in LEY, which betrays its origin.
"
886,Unusual declamatory talk after President meets resistance,ABERRANT,"Mr Lincoln, ABE, is our president; then it’s R for ‘resistance’ followed by RANT for ‘declamatory talk’.
"
887,"Regularly lacking dignity, uncivil, enter uninvited",INTRUDE,"Raich is inviting you to add INT, the second, fourth and sixth letters of ‘dignity’ to RUDE for ‘uncivil’ to give you a word meaning to ‘enter uninvited’.  ‘Regularly lacking’ is an indication to leave out the other letters of ‘dignity’.
"
888,"Wife has fit, seeing one in the water?",WHALE,"W as an abbreviation for ‘wife’ is followed by HALE for ‘fit’ to give a marine mammal, one species of which is the biggest animal on the planet.  HALE is in the dictionary as ‘fit’ or ‘healthy’, but is usually only heard in the expression ‘hale and hearty’, which is a pleonasm, since both words mean essentially the same thing.
"
889,"To sum up, there’s uncertainty about Northern cheese",IN BRIEF,"The surface tickled my fancy.  I originally thought IF for ‘uncertainty’ was a bit of a push, but now I think about it, it’s made clear by the phrase ‘Ifs and buts’, or ‘That’s a big if’.  Anyway, If you put that around N BRIE for ‘Northern cheese’ you’ve got your answer.
"
890,Notice sedge at first in river and a lake,DEAD SEA,"Another smooth surface.  It’s AD for ‘notice’ and S for the first letter of ‘sedge’ in DEE for the river followed by A.  Are seas and lakes synonymous?  In Crypticland they are.
"
891,Money trouble at Southern factories,MILLS,"A charade of M for ‘money’, ILL for ‘trouble’ and S for ‘southern’.  Which is slightly perverse, because you only get trouble at t’mill up north.
"
892,Lines to feature in fashionable summit,HILLTOP,"An insertion of LL for ‘lines’ and TO in HIP for ‘fashionable’.
"
893,"Learner’s entries being corrected, he pays attention",LISTENER,"A charade of L for ‘learner’ anagram of as in L-plates) and (ENTRIES;  The apostrophe ‘s is indicating ‘has’ rather than ‘is’ to make the clue work.
"
894,"Best of times, having money in the sea by Cannes?",SUMMER,"A charade of SUM for ‘money’ and MER, which is what those who live in Cannes would call the sea.  Most people would consider SUMMER to be the best of ‘times’ or ‘seasons’, although spring is my personal favourite.
"
895,"A feat, however you look at it",DEED,"Because whether you look at it backwards or forwards, DEED comes out the same.
"
896,She works in sales with added energy,LASS,"The definition is ‘she’ and it’s SAL[E]S, the answer giving us the definition for the three child star clues.  But I’m not sure exactly how this works, so would welcome comments on the parsing.
"
897,"Aid not on?  That’s wrong, as this may suggest",DONATION,"anagram of AID NOT ON;  ‘That’s wrong’ is the anagrind, and it’s &lit(ish).
"
898,Foolish to accept everyone’s case for money,WALLET,"An insertion of ALL for ‘everyone’ in WET.  ‘Foolish’ for WET is in my opinion a bit of an ask; for me, ‘wet’ is more ‘feeble’ or ‘toothless’.  Although the hangers and floggers in the Conservative Party would no doubt attach Raich’s sense to the ‘Tory Wets’.
"
899,Democrat replaces Republican in group that decides,JUDY,"The second damsel.  Pretty obvious that you need a D to replace an R, but you’d likely need 27 before you could solve it; or in my case, 27 and both the crossing letters.  It’s JU[R]Y with the D as the replacement letter.
"
900,"Moored in Trieste, a merchant ship",STEAMER,"Nicely hidden in TrieSTE A MERchant.
"
901,"When asked to enumerate requisites at first, list a turbine",WATER WHEEL,"The first letters of When Asked To Enumerate Requisites and WHEEL for ‘list’.  Unless I’m missing something, these are pretty distant synonyms.  My first sense of ‘list’ is what ships do when they tilt over.
"
902,Subdeacon initially tense over a new Church position,STANCE,"A charade of S for the first letter of ‘subdeacon’ and T for ‘tense’ over (since it’s a down clue) A, N and CE.  Good surface.
"
903,Good idea finally to overlay both sides with flowers,GARLAND,"I only saw how this worked when I was writing up the blog.  It’s G for ‘good’, A for the last letter of ‘idea’, on top of RL for ‘both sides’ and AND for ‘with’.
"
904,Apprehension seen in US as misplaced,UNEASINESS,"anagram of SEEN IN US AS;  ‘Misplaced’ is the anagrind.
"
905,Father and son have to be told,RELATED,"A dd.
"
906,"To help sober up, this is provided after drunken sprees?",ESPRESSO,"A charade of anagram of SPREES; and SO. SO and ‘this’ have equivalence in sentences like ‘It’s so important’ and ‘It’s *this* important’, which is why Raich has put the this in italics.  I think.
"
907,"reserved, entertaining Irish and the French",SHIRLEY,"The third colleen.  An insertion of IR for ‘Irish’ and LE for a French definite article in SHY for ‘reserved’.
"
908,Athlete’s accommodating a writer from America,MAILER,"An insertion of A in MILER for a runner.  Norman Mailer, the American author who was married six times and had nine children, but found time in between to write.
"
909,Met up over detailed request in place of worship,TEMPLE,"This was one of my ‘has to be that but why?’ clues.  I eventually worked out that it’s a reversal of ‘met’, TEM, over PLE[A], which is a request that’s been de-tailed (like the trio of visually-impaired rodents).
"
910,"School class, it’s taken by QC",SILK,"A charade of S for ‘school’ and ILK for ‘class’.  Some object to the use of ‘of that ilk’ for ‘of that class’, because its original meaning referred to Scottish families and estates; but its general use is now very well established.
"
911,Levy on fatty food?,CORPORATION TAX,"If you’re going to raise a smile, you might as well do it with 1ac.  An amusing cd.
"
912,Logical basis for 15 getting left in charge,RATIONALE,"An insertion of IONA, the solution to 15ac and L in RATE for ‘charge’.
"
913,School qualification of the third highest grade,GAMMA,"A charade of GAM for an alternative collective noun for ‘school’ or ‘pod’ of whales, and MA for Master of Arts gives you the third letter of the Greek alphabet, used for grading pieces of work.  Or human beings, if you’ve read Aldous Huxley’s *Brave New World*: ‘Gammas are stupid.  They all wear green.  I’m so glad I’m a Beta.’
"
914,"Semites in diaspora, apparently",IT SEEMS,"Nice surface.  anagram of SEMITES;  ‘In diaspora’ – in other words, scattered – is the anagrind.
"
915,A one point stone,PERIDOT,"A charade of PER (as in 90p per/a kilo) and I DOT gives you the green gemstone.
"
916,Ridiculous clot in FIFA is a cause of severe distress,AFFLICTION,"anagram of CLOT IN FIFA;  Wouldn’t be an Eimi puzzle without a bit of footie, would it?  You can take it at face value, but if you follow the beautiful game, it would have made you laugh.  It’s a dig at Sepp Blatter, who’s currently and unfortunately president of FIFA, football’s world governing body.  The latest gem from what passes for his brain is that it’s okay to make racist comments to a fellow player during a game as long as you shake hands at the end of it.  Muppet.
"
917,"Hebridean location of newspaper proprietor, it might be said",IONA,"Another smiley (and slightly self-referential) moment.  It’s a homophone (‘it might be said’) of ‘i owner’.  The i is the Indy’s little sister paper, which has recently celebrated its 1st birthday and is a snip at only 20p.  It’s got a cryptic every day as well, from the usual crew.  Are they recycled?  I think we should be told.
"
918,Not Hard Times in particular,WAXY,"Well, ‘waxy’ means ‘not hard’ (‘of a person, soft, impressionable’ says the SOED) and it’s X for ‘times’ in WAY; but how we get from WAY to ‘particular’ I’m unsure of.  The SOED gives at definition 14 ‘an aspect, a feature, a respect’ but I’m struggling to think of an example of how that would be used.
"
919,Of course they’re not main components,SIDE DISHES,"A cd.
"
920,Operetta composer consuming very last of cheese and port,LE HAVRE,"The enumeration and a starting L had me looking for an operetta; but it’s the French port.  You need to know (or in my case find out from my trusty and dog-eared Thesaurus) that Franz Lehár was a Hungarian composer.  Put V for ‘very’ inside that and then add E for the last letter of ‘cheese’ and Robert est votre oncle.  Thanks to the wonders of the Internet, I can tell you that Lehár’s best known operetta is *The Merry Widow*.
"
921,Good seafaring name for sailor back in Ohio perhaps,HORATIO,"An insertion of RAT for TAR reversed in anagram of OHIO;  Referring of course to HORATIO NELSON, whose second name has been adopted in cricket terminology for a score of 111 or its multiples.  I could explain why, but it’s rude.
"
922,Dissatisfaction with regular samples of Lennon music,ENNUI,"A word for ‘boredom’ or ‘dissatisfaction’ comes from the regular letters in lEnNoN mUsIc.
"
923,How one might describe actors having a bit of a kip outside flat,APARTMENT,"I think this is PART MEN for ‘actors’ surrounded by AT, but how that equates to ‘bit of a kip’ I can’t see.  But someone out there no doubt can.
"
924,Superior title,REVEREND MOTHER,"A cd.  I like ’em; some don’t.
"
925,Lord Chancellor has written terribly drily on case law,CARDINAL WOLSEY,"anagram of DRILY ON CASE LAW;  ‘Written terribly’ is the anagrind.  Thomas Wolsey was Lord Chancellor under Henry VIII.
"
926,"Financial factors creating a forest, perhaps",RATES OF EXCHANGE,"This is one of those reverse anagrams. (Is that the right term?  I never know.)  If you EXCHANGE the letters of RATES OF, you create ‘a forest’.
"
927,Moose oil refined for a song,O SOLE MIO,"anagram of MOOSE OIL;  ‘Refined’ is the anagrind.  It’s the Neapolitan song which translates as ‘my sun’.  Bring out the Cornettos.
"
928,"Semites, some Muslims Barack upset",ARABS,"Hidden reversed in MuslimS BARAck.  Both Jews and Arabs are Semites, since they are supposedly descended from Shem, the son of Noah.
"
929,"Forerunner of Skype lacking volume, it’s said",IDEOPHONE,"For the technophobic and elderly (I qualify only for the latter) Skype is a piece of software that allows you to make voice and video calls over the Internet, often for free.  I presume that IDEOPHONE was an earlier version of something similar, and although a homophone is suggested, I can’t parse this, I’m afraid.
"
930,First-class return from one African country to another,NIGER,"This relies on the fact that if you take IA (a reversal of A1 for ‘first-class’) from NIGERIA, you’re left with another African country.  It’s a great surface.
"
931,Braced for conflict?,ARMED TO THE TEETH,"A cd, referring to the braces that teenagers wear to straighten wonky teeth.
"
932,Former president smuggled trifle inside vehicle,CAR TRANSPORTER,"An insertion of RAN and SPORT inside CARTER for the former US President.
"
933,Colourless hydrocarbon created in experiment,TRIDECANE,"anagram of CREATED IN;  ‘Experiment’ is the anagrind, I suppose in the sense of ‘play about with’.  The hydrocarbon(s) with the general formula C13H28.
"
934,Horrible to find a hole in material,VOILE,"An insertion of O for ‘hole’ in VILE gives you the lightweight material used especially for blouses and dresses, as well as curtains.

"
936,A stubborn type beginning to trust a lucky charm,AMULET,"A charade of A MULE and T for the first letter of ‘trust’.
"

"
938,"Choked, the lord upset about IOM race",THROTTLED,"anagram of THE LORD; around TT for the often fatal Isle of Man motorbike races.  ‘Upset’ is the anagrind.  The clue prompted me to find out what TT means: it’s ‘Tourist Trophy’.
"
939,Unusual paperback?,NOVEL,"A dd.
"
940,I frame Swedish director seducing new Swedish actress,INGRID BERGMAN,"An insertion of N for ‘new’ in I GRID and BERGMAN for the Swedish producer Ingmar BERGMAN (no relation). ‘Seducing’ is the insertion indicator, presumably in the sense of ‘attracting’.  Anyway, it’s a good surface reading.  INGRID BERGMAN is probably best remembered for playing Isla Lund in *Casablanca* opposite Humphrey Bogart.  ‘Play it again, Sam’ is one of the famous movie misquotes; she never said that.  What she actually said was ‘Play it, Sam’.
"
941,Device that spins to and fro,ROTATOR,"The clue is relying on the fact that ROTATOR is a palindrome.
"
942,"Drink, more bubbly, for top boss",SUPREMO,"A charade of SUP and anagram of MORE;  ‘Bubbly’ is the anagrind.

"
953,Popular group struggling badly,IN DIRE STRAITS,"Everyman’s on a bit of a rock ‘n’ roll mission today.  It’s IN for ‘popular’ and DIRE STRAITS for Mark Knopfler’s lot.  I’m partial to a bit of Dire Straits myself, particularly the hauntingly melancholic ‘Romeo and Juliet’.
"
954,Note small car on motorway,MINIM,"More music.  A MINIM is the musical note that’s worth two crotchets and is a charade of MINI and M for ‘motorway’.

"
959,Further loan,ADVANCE,"A dd, relying on the English language’s capacity to have nounal and verbal meanings of the same word.

"
965,It sounds like opportunity to slow down,BRAKE,"A homophone clue, indicated by ‘sounds like’.  An ‘opportunity’ is a ‘break’, which sounds like BRAKE.
"
966,Protest heatedly when canaries are mistreated?  I’ll participate,RAISE CAIN,"Nothing to do with the little birds down the pit who used to alert miners to noxious gases by their failure to continue singing.  It’s anagram of CANARIES I; and ‘mistreated’ is the anagrind.  The CAIN bit comes from the Old Testament, where he was, together with Abel, one of Adam and Eve’s two sons, but the exact derivation of the phrase I don’t know.
"
967,"Travelling home, with money and much time invested, start to tremble",ITINERANT,"An indication that you should insert TIN for ‘money’ and ERA for ‘much time’ in IN for ‘home’, and then add the first letter of ‘tremble’ to produce an adjective for ‘travelling’.

972,Wear for diner from Penzance?,SWEATER,"It’s corny, but I like it.  It’s suggesting that a diner from the south-west of England, where Penzance is, would be a SW EATER.
"
973,"Lady golfer, extremely impressive",ELSIE,"The girl’s name is a charade of Ernie ELS, the setters’ favourite golfer, and the outer letters of ImpressivE.  What will compilers do when he retires?
"
974,"Lacking current, train heading for Sheffield not on time”  Explain in simple language!",TRANSLATE,"Well, perhaps not one of Raich’s most concise or elegant clues, but it’s all there: take I for ‘current’ out of TRA[I]N, add S for the first letter of Sheffield, and LATE for ‘not on time’ to give you your answer.  ‘I’ as the symbol for electrical ‘current’ is derived from the French ‘intensité de courant’, apparently.
"
975,Reparation is intrinsic to caveat one mentioned,ATONEMENT,"Hidden answers are supposed to be the ones the setter gives you to get going, but this was cleverly hidden, and one of my last in.  It’s there in caveAT ONE MENTioned.  Though it’s naff all to do with the clue, it put me in mind of Ian McEwan’s 2001 novel and the subsequent film starring Kiera Knightley and James McAvoy.

"
979,What characterises judge could be expressed as “Bye riots”?,SOBRIETY,"A bit of a clunky surface reading, but again, it’s clear what’s needed: anagram of BYE RIOTS; and ‘could be expressed’ is the anagrind.  It’s referring to the expression ‘sober as a judge’.

"
981,Native American wrapping soft fabric,CREPE,"‘Native American’ in a clue normally triggers CREE for me, and thus it was with this clue.  If you put P for musically ‘soft’ in it, you get the fabric.
"
982,Potential follower of 23 is certain to accommodate guy on the way up,SURNAME,"I got this pretty much straight off from the clear cluing – a reversal of MAN in SURE – but then took a while to understand that since 23ac is ELSIE, which is a first name, then a SURNAME might follow.  For me this was a hmmm sort of clue.
"
983,"Somehow be so nice, aiming in the beginning to show deference",OBEISANCE,"anagram of BE SO NICE A;  ‘Somehow’ is the anagrind.
"
984,Card displaying beverages (English),TEASE,"A charade of TEAS for ‘beverages’ and E for ‘English’.  ‘A witty, entertaining or eccentric person’ (Collins).

"
989,Something colourful produced by writer going over lines?,GREENERY,"A charade of Graham GREENE, the author, and RY for railway, or ‘lines’.  GREENERY is colourful, of course, but only one colour; for me the word suggests more that there are many colours in there, like Joseph’s coat of many colours.

"
991,Greatly upset Southern tile supplier,SHATTER,"A charade of S for ‘Southern’ and HATTER for ’tile supplier’.  ‘Tile’ is slang for ‘hat’.

"
994,Fight waste,SCRAP,"A dd.
"
995,Slander that’s initially brought to light in the German lawsuit,DETRACTION,"My first thought here once I’d got a few crossing letters was DEFAMATION, but of course that doesn’t work.  It’s a clever surface, though: T for the first letter of ‘that’s’ in DER for one of the (many) words for ‘the’ in German, followed by ACTION for ‘lawsuit’.  First flashback, to ‘calumny and detraction’ in the Catechism.
"
996,Problem involving a hundred despicable people,SCUM,"An insertion of C for the Roman numeral for ‘a hundred’ in SUM for ‘problem’.

1002,A thunder god in action?  One has no fear whatever,DREADNOUGHT,"anagram of A THUNDER GOD; with ‘in action’ as the anagrind.  I knew DREADNOUGHT as a battleship, but another definition, I discovered today, is ‘a fearless person’.

"
1004,One may be seen as a bulge at sea,BELUGA,"anagram of A BULGE;  ‘At sea’ is the anagrind.  A bit of &litishness.

"
1007,I’d cycle round having eaten a titbit,DELICACY,"anagram of I’D CYCLE A;  ‘Round’ is the anagrind, and ‘titbit’ is the definition, although our friends across the pond would say tidbit, for a reason I’ve never understood.
"
1008,One may be feeling cold needing to get into shelter with drink,TENTACLE,"I liked this surface.  It’s a charade of TENT and an insertion of C in ALE.
"
1009,Seasonal music to be played by laddies (set fee),ADESTE FIDELES,"Second flashback, since singing hymns and other stuff in Latin was the preferred option when I was at school.  It’s anagram of LADDIES SET FEE; and is the Latin version of ‘O Come All Ye Faithful’

"
1017,"Looking to heaven, one man chanted a part of the Mass",AGNUS DEI,"The third of my Holy Trinity of flashbacks.  The answer is Latin for ‘Lamb of God’ and is part of the Catholic Mass.  It’s cleverly clued: a reversal (‘looking to heaven’) of I ED SUNG A.

"

"
1051,Clergyman is to lose his head soon,ANON,"[C]ANON.
"
1052,Ban in street a busker,TABU,"The answer couldn’t be much else, but you’d have to know that TABU is an alternative spelling of TABOO, and that it also has a verbal form.  It’s hidden in streeT A BUsker.
"
1053,Fellow on a cruise taking front of boat for sun moved anchor,FIONA BRUCE,"Hmmm.   You need to replace the S for ‘sun’ in ‘cruise’ with B for the first letter of ‘boat’, then it’s a charade of F for ‘fellow’ and anagram of ON A CRUIBE; with ‘moved’ as the anagrind and ‘anchor’ as the definition.  Ms Bruce has anchored the BBC television news for many years. You have to say it’s a good surface, though.
"
1054,Place for learning fashion on the net?,ETON,"A whimsical way of saying that if you had fashion on the internet, it might be E-TON.  TON is another word for fashion, and ETON is a college where the younger boys learn how to warm lavatory seats for the older boys or otherwise endure a severe beating.  It’s called fagging, whence – apparently – the expression ‘it’s a right fag’ .
"
1055,Woman in confined place regarding lunchtime food,CANNELLONI,"An insertion of ANN in CELL plus ON for ‘regarding’; but I have no idea how we get from ‘lunchtime’ to I (if indeed that is how the clue works).

"
1058,A loud terrier discontented barking around a yard like a spaniel?,ADULATORY,"Once you had the crossing letters, it couldn’t be much else, but I couldn’t parse this.  Okay, A LOUD is going to be part of the anagram fodder, but I was into TA for ‘terrier’ and couldn’t work out the rest.  So after calling in help, I can tell you that it’s A Y for ‘a yard’ around anagram of A LOUD TR;  The TR bit comes from TerrieR, which is ‘discontented’, in other words having its contents taken out and leaving the first and last letters.  ‘Barking’ is the anagrind and one of the definitions of ‘a spaniel’ is ‘an obsequiously devoted person’ (SOED).
"
1059,Old soldiers might be found in this heap,CRATE,"Another one where the answer can’t be anything else, but again I had to ask for help with the parsing.  Apparently ‘old soldiers’ are ’empty bottles’ (a new one on me) and those are found, obviously, in a CRATE, which is a slang term for a clapped-out car.
"
1060,"Fine Catholic bishop, one held in repute among Americans in restricted area of travel",AIR CORRIDOR,"A further multi-part answer, which I couldn’t parse for ages.  It’s a charade of AI for ‘fine’; then Hypnos is asking you to add RC for ‘Catholic’ and an insertion of RR (Right Reverend) and I in ODOR for the American spelling of ODOUR.  There’s a bit going on here, n’est-ce pas?  I had never come across ODOUR/ODOR for ‘repute’ before.
"
1061,Stellar group in a society with unusual poise protected by agents,CASSIOPEIA,"The constellation is an insertion of A and S plus anagram of POISE; in CIA for American agents.
"
1062,Corruption in City I eliminated and cleared – a natural economic feature?,TRADE CYCLE,"anagram of C[I]TY CLEARED;
"
1063,Endure rude fellow,BEAR,"A dd.  Can’t say I’d heard of the nounal definition, but the SOED gives ‘a rough, unmannerly, or uncouth person’.
"
1064,"In river, coach ruined garment",TRENCH COAT,"An insertion of anagram of COACH; in the River TRENT.  ‘Ruined’ is the anagrind.

"
1071,Refined family around river taking in source of riotous colour,ULTRAMARINE,"Well, there ain’t many 11-letter colours starting with U, so I slapped this in straightaway, but parsing it proved more tricky.  It’s U for ‘refined’; then you need to insert R for the first letter of ‘riotous’ in the River TAMAR and insert all that in LINE for ‘family’.  I did say there were some multi-part clues in this one.
"
1072,Study a Northern Irish writer – or an old one,CONAN DOYLE,"Another one I liked.  A charade of CON for ‘study’, A, N for ‘Northern’ and DOYLE for the Irish writer Roddy Doyle, whose 1993 Booker Prize winning novel *Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha* I much enjoyed at the time, and whose book *The Commitments* was made into a successful film.
"
1073,One investigating upcoming series on English peer,RESEARCHER,"Another charade of RES for a reversal of SER for ‘series’, E, and ARCHER for the disgraced Tory peer Lord Archer.
"
1074,Page Roy and Garth lacking skill messed up in subject,GEOGRAPHY,"You need to take ‘art’ for ‘skill’ out of ‘Garth’; then it’s anagram of PAGE ROY GH; with ‘messed up’ as the anagrind.
"

"
1077,Regulars in bars with final space for economic expansion?,ASIA,"I thought this was hard.  You need to put ‘bars and final’ together, then take the regular letters: bArSfInAl.  The clue is suggesting that Asia’s economy is set to expand.

"
1096,Sick son given place to sit in church,SPEW,"A word for ‘sick’ is a charade of S and PEW.

"
1105,Decoration’s advancing with no hint of inharmoniousness,GONG,"GO[I]NG, and the first of a number of clues with a removal – in this case the first letter of ‘inharmoniousness’.  Funny surface – how can a decoration advance?
"

"
1107,Notice not applicable – employ a maiden for ever,AD NAUSEAM,"A charade of AD, NA, USE and A M for the Latin phrase.  Strictly the definition should lead to AD INFINITUM, but the clue works fine for me.

"
1109,"Unacceptable, whichever way you look at it",NOT ON,"Because NOT ON is a palindrome.
"
1110,"Cardinal’s prudish, fairly oddly",PRIMARY,"A charade of PRIM and fAiRlY, for the adjectival meaning of ‘cardinal’.  A, R and Y are the even letters of ‘fairly’ though – does ‘oddly’ work here?
"

"
1112,Medic rebuffing suitable design,MOTIF,"A charade of MO for ‘medical officer’ and a reversal of FIT for ‘suitable’.

"
1116,Performance by a Latin duo gets pats on the back,ADULATION,"anagram of A LATIN DUO;  ‘Performance’ is the anagrind, but I’d consider ADULATION to be a bit more than a ‘pat on the back’.  And of course LAUDATION also fits.
"
1117,Do the twist with Shirley?  Pirouetting sure to be de trop,WHIRL,"There’s a bit going on here, in my opinion.  It’s a charade of W for ‘with’ and HIRL, which you arrive at by shedding (because it’s ‘de trop’) SEY from ‘Shirley’; and SEY is YES (‘sure’) reversed.
"
1118,Sounding a bit on the borderline,KERB,"Couldn’t see this, but ‘when in doubt look in the dictionary’ would have been a good approach.  SOED for ‘curb’: ‘A chain or strap passing under the lower jaw of a horse and attached to the bit.’  ‘Sounding’ is the homophone indicator and a KERB, which is a homophone in anyone’s language of CURB, is on the border between the pavement and the road.

"
1120,Old illuminators used small point for the most part,OIL LAMPS,"anagram of SMALL POI; with ‘used’ as the anagrind.  I’m not a big fan of clues like this, since there is no clear indication that you need to remove only the last two letters of ‘point’.  Okay, three out of five letters is ‘for the most part’, but I still don’t like it, probably because I’m of an age where I’m turning into a Grumpy Old Man.
"
1121,No Conservative complaints about this philosophy,PLATONISM,"This was phone a friend time, I’m afraid, but now it’s been explained to me, I can’t see why.  I was off thinking about conservative people being into Platonic relationships, but that was complete pants.  It’s simply anagram of [C]OMPLAINTS; with ‘about’ as the anagrind.  Given the high number of clues with letters removed in this puzzle, I should have seen this and been able to save my phone bill.

"
1173,Source of boiling water removing top from weed behind wood,TEA KETTLE,"When Punk’s in town, you can usually rely on ‘weed’ having something to do with urination, but this time it’s a double bluff: the setter’s asking you to remove the top from [N]ETTLE and stick that after TEAK for the ‘wood’.

1178,John Thomas?,CRAPPER,"Well, here’s your willy and bum references in the same clue.  ‘John Thomas’ is a slang term for the *membrum virile*, but it’s actually nothing to do with said member.  It’s ‘John’ in the lavatorial sense, and Thomas CRAPPER didn’t invent the flushable toilet, but filed a number of patents to do with it, so it’s a kind of dd cum cd, I suppose.  ‘John Thomas and Lady Jane’ was an alternative title of D H Lawrence’s *Lady Chatterley’s Lover*, since ‘John Thomas’ is the name the gamekeeper gave to his willy.  Country folk are odd, aren’t they?
"
1179,"Gold top a third raised, one in four sections",ORCHESTRA,"Here come the boobs (to be reprised later).  It’s OR for ‘gold’, CHEST for ‘top’ , and RA for a third of RAised.  And Punk’s left the carthorse in her stable.
"
1180,"Scottish area admitting book woeful with odd bits deleted, the other information",FACTS OF LIFE,"We’ve had the drugs; here comes the sex, or sex-ed.  Put ACTS, one of the books of the New Testament, plus OFL for ‘woeful’ with the odd letters deleted, into FIFE for the ‘Scottish area’ and you’ve got the information about sex (‘the other’, as in ‘Fancy a bit of the other?’), that we all sat down with our children to discuss.  Or perhaps we left it to school to sort out.
"
1181,Cake with tripe unfinished,BUN,"BUN[K].  Is a cake a bun?  Discuss.
"
1182,"Little boy getting in between sheets, perhaps",LINEN,"An insertion of IN in LEN, a ‘little boy’.  I’m not a big fan of these ‘little boy’ clues to indicate an abbreviated first name, but I’d better get used to it, ’cause it ain’t going away.
"
1183,Girl clutching mountain plant,VERBENA,"An insertion of the Scottish BEN (as in Ben Nevis) in VERA.
"
1184,Syrian mother has a part to play,DAMASCENE,"Great surface.  A synonym for ‘Syrian’ (in other words, ‘from Damascus’) is a charade of DAM for ‘mother’ and A SCENE.  I learnt from another puzzle the other day that the fabric DAMASK is so-called because its origins are in Damascus.
"
1185,Maybe lead me into group in embrace of fertility god,BASE METAL,"Punk’s relying on the remarkable ability of English to have two completely different pronunciations of the same word.  The definition is ‘lead’ (as in Pb) and it’s an insertion of ME into SET, surrounded by BAAL, the god of fertility.
"
1186,Strip to get acting role?,TAKE APART,"A dd. If you ‘strip’ the engine on your car, you take it apart; if you’re offered an acting role, you TAKE A PART.
"

"

"
1189,Bird English composer sent skywards,GREBE,"The delightful aquatic bird is a reversal of E for ‘English’ and the Austrian composer Alban BERG (although a quick flirt online suggests there are other BERGS that you could choose from).
"
1190,"Singer lacking polish, bound to need discipline",DUSTY SPRINGFIELD,"The chanteuse from the 60s is a charade of DUSTY for ‘lacking polish’, SPRING for ‘bound’ and FIELD for ‘discipline’.
"
1191,"Boob, a palindrome!",TIT,"I guess you can work this out for yourselves, but come back to me below if not …
"
1192,Waggish pair?  Neither owns to being criminal,THE TWO RONNIES,"Well done if you got this straight off.  I guessed the anagram fodder but needed some crossing letters to see that it was THE TWO somethings.  anagram of NEITHER OWNS TO; with ‘criminal’ as the anagrind, and referring to the famous pair of comedians who were at the top of their game in the 1980s.  ‘Four candles?’  ‘Nah, fork handles.’
"
1193,It’s used for galvanising last character in college,ZINC,"A charade of Z for the last letter of our alphabet, IN and C for ‘college’ for the bluish-white metal that is used for galvanising.
"
1194,Request at home before formal call is denied,INVITATION,"A charade of IN for ‘at home’ and V[IS]ITATION.
"
1195,Republican for all to see in stormy battle supplying contrary argument,REBUTTAL,"Another charade of R for ‘Republican’ and U in anagram of BATTLE;  ‘Stormy’ is the anagrind and the U bit comes from the U (Universal) Certificate in cinemas which means that anyone can see it.
"
1196,"In part, young child is lacking time for grub",ROOTLE,"This was my last in.  I was into grub = larva mode, then grub = food mode; but it’s ‘grub’ as a verb.  ROOTLE: ‘Of an animal, turn up the ground etc with the snout, beak, in search of food.’  The kind of stuff that pigs and aardvarks do.  It’s an insertion of [T]OT in ROLE.
"
1197,Group of workers engaged in drink and short exercise,SIT,"-UPThe exercise that’s good for your six-pack.  An insertion of IT for ‘group of (information technology) workers’ in SUP.
"
1198,"Character touring storage facility with book, source of notes",TROMBONE,"It’s TONE for ‘character’ around (‘touring’) ROM for ‘read-only memory’ and B for ‘book’.
"
1199,Conservative idol largely enthusiastic or one found with reservations?,CHEROKEE,"A charade of C, HERO and KEE[N] for the Native Americans.
"
1200,"Sudden increase in fabric, we hear?",SURGE,"A homophone, and clearly indicated which way round it is: we hear ‘serge’, the fabric; but the answer’s SURGE.
"
1201,Hairdresser generally on reflection concealed a means of leaving,EGRESS,"Hidden reversed (‘on reflection’) in ‘hairdreSSER GEnerally’.
"
1202,Staged work represented in a hotel,IOLANTHE,"anagram of IN A HOTEL;  ‘Represented’ is the anagrind and even I’d heard of this Gilbert and Sullivan work, although I’m no aficionado.
"
1203,One exposed to view touring a lake?,NATURALIST,"I think this is &littish, unless someone wants to disabuse me of that idea.  It’s an insertion of A L in NATURIST, to give you the name for someone who’s admiring the view of nature.
"
1204,Dismiss old wine,SACK,"A dd.
"
1205,Source of funds and wealth in Hello under review,HOLE IN THE WALL,"anagram of WEALTH IN HELLO; with ‘under review’ as the anagrind, for what’s more properly known as an ATM.
"
1206,Fancy stripe worn by corps – an army feature?,TRICEPS,"It’s C for one of the accepted abbreviations for ‘corps’ surrounded by anagram of STRIPE; with ‘fancy’ as the anagrind.  The question mark is (I think) suggesting in a whimsical way that since the army are renowned for their strength, this particular muscle in the arms of soldiers might be part of their armoury.
"
1207,Face matter occupying uppity Frenchman,ENCOUNTER,"A synonym for ‘to face’ is an insertion of COUNT (in the verbal sense: it doesn’t count/it doesn’t matter) in a reversal of RENÉ, crosswordland’s favourite Frenchman, who’s BFF with Otto the German.
"
1208,Rubbish picked up in part of frame,WAIST,"A homophone of ‘waste’ for ‘rubbish’, with ‘picked up’ as the homphone indicator.  Good surface.
"
1209,A lot of split rubber beginning to thin and burn,RIVULET,"Well, ‘burn’ as a ‘small river’ or RIVULET is the definition and T as its last letter is the first letter of ‘thin’, but where the split rubber comes in, I can’t see.  VUL could be from VULCANISED for the term relating to rubber, but I’ll need someone else to explain this fully, please.
"
1210,How one might describe carnival hater’s response to American – worthy of shame?,NOTORIOUS,"Another whimsical indication of how somebody who didn’t like the Rio de Janiero carnival might react, added to US for ‘American’.
"

"
1213,Asian and a son in outfit beset by a lot of fear,PAKISTANI,"Two insertions and a deletion: one insertion of S for ‘son’ in KIT for ‘outfit’; then an insertion of all that in PANI[C], ‘a lot of fear’.
"
1214,Banger is falling apart traversing European body of water,BERING SEA,"anagram of BANGER IS; around E with ‘falling apart’ as the anagrind.
"
1215,School right to leave hospital garbage,HOGWASH,"Very contemporary, since the last Harry Potter film came out only recently.  Hogwarts is the school of wizardry where Harry, Ron and Hermione went; take RT for ‘right’ out of that and add H for ‘hospital’ and you’ve got a word meaning ‘rubbish’ or ‘garbage’.  This morning’s trivia question: what does the JK in JK Rowling stand for?  Answer at the end.
"
1216,A defender of cream?,ELITIST,"A cd, since the ‘cream’ of anything would be the best, and elitism is about supporting only the best.
"
1217,Proper doctor coming up to admit first of those horribly injured,ETHICAL,"Clever, and I’m going for this as my favourite clue this morning.  ‘Doctor’ usually gets used as an anagrind, or as an indication to use an abbreviation (MO, MD, DR, GP and so on).  But here it’s in the verbal sense, as in to ‘lace’ or ‘doctor’ a drink.  So it’s a reversal of LACE with an insertion of THI for the first letters of ‘those horribly injured’.
"
1218,English bird I ignored in uniform,EQUAL,"E plus QUA[I]L.
"
1219,Means for turning in old part of county,LATHE,"It’s a dd, but the second definition is archaic: ‘Each of the administrative districts into which Kent was formerly divided, each comprising several hundreds’ (SOED).
"
1220,Start over with no restrictions,OPEN,"-ENDEDA charade of OPEN for ‘start’ and ENDED for ‘over’.
"
1221,Available hot or cold?,ON TAP,"A cd.
"
1222,"Stop me returning to pub, then depart",EMBARGO,"A synonym for ‘stop’ is a three-part charade: EM (‘me’ reversed), BAR and GO.
"
1223,Entertainer seen throwing up,JUGGLER,"A cd, and a good one.
"
1224,Sizeable first edition made one’s fortune,FATE,"A charade of FAT and E for the first letter of ‘edition’.
"
1225,Break off with a cabbalist,SABBATICAL,"anagram of A CABBALIST;  ‘Off with’ is the anagrind.
"
1226,Spiritual studies signalling attack of conscience,REMORSE,"A charade of RE for Religious Education and MORSE as in Morse Code.
"
1227,Check before opening,PREVENT,"It’s a good surface, but I’m less keen on PRE as a fairly loose definition of ‘before’.  If you follow that with VENT for ‘opening’ then you’ve got a verb meaning ‘to check’.
"
1228,Cooking ingredient from dud drug?,LEMON GRASS,"A charade of LEMON in the sense of ‘dud’ and GRASS as a slang term for marijuana.
"
1229,Sound system by which hospital units accept fine,HI,"-FIBeale’s asking you to put F for ‘fine’ inside H for ‘hospital’ and two Is for ‘units’.
"
1230,Fruit served with wine is fashionable,ROSEHIP,"A charade of ROSE for the wine and HIP for ‘fashionable’.
"
1231,Stylish without lead actor’s books all over the place,CHAOTIC,"There’s a bit going on here.  CHIC is ‘stylish’.  ‘Without’ is an insertion indicator and the inserted material is A for the first letter of ‘actor’ and OT, Old Testament for ‘books’.
"
1232,Criticise after inclusion of each hymn,PAEAN,"An inclusion of EA for ‘each’ in PAN for ‘criticise’.
"
1233,"Dismissed, pathetic, penniless and headstrong, then exits",FIRE DOORS,"Again, there’s a lot going on here in a crossword promoted as ‘for beginners’.  ‘Dismissed’ is FIRED, then OOR is [P]OOR (‘pathetic’ without P for penny, ie ‘penniless’ and S for the first letter of ‘strong’ (‘headstrong’).
"
1234,Tie up pension in advance to get return for little effort,MONEY FOR OLD ROPE,"The answer was obvious once you had a few crossing letters, but I couldn’t see this for ages.  It’s a charade: ‘tie up’ is ROPE and MONEY FOR OLD is ‘pension’.
"
1235,Precisely spoken student left with man,VERBATIM,"Another one I struggled with.  The definition is ‘precisely’ and it’s VERBA[L] (‘spoken’ after L for learner or ‘student’ has left) plus TIM for ‘man’.
"
1236,Tried diligently to grasp point,HEARD,"An insertion of E for a ‘point’ of the compass in HARD in its adverbial sense (‘diligently’).  HEARD in its judicial meaning.
"
1237,Supporter of bill gets about during election,ADVOCATE,"A further rather complicated clue.  It’s a charade of AD for ‘bill’ and and insertion of CA for circa, or ‘about’ in VOTE.
"
1238,One suffering from reduced chances secures casual work,ODD JOB,"It’s a charade of ODD[S] for ‘reduced chances’ and JOB as the Biblical figure who suffered, but I’m not sure that ‘from’ is a good indicator of putting the latter after the former.
"
1239,Neglected grotto built in marshy area,FORGOTTEN,"An insertion of ORGOTT, which is anagram of GROTTO; in FEN.  ‘Built’ is the anagrind.
"
1240,Typeface taken from digital icon,ITALIC,"Hidden in digITAL ICon.
"
1241,It helps one get up and about,SPIRAL STAIRCASE,"A cd, but not a very good one in my opinion.
"
1242,Cutting short attempt at charm,TRENCHANT,"A word meaning ‘cutting’ (as in ‘cutting remark’) is a charade of TR[Y] for ‘short attempt’ and ENCHANT.
"
1243,Final reminder during podcast disguised the message,POSTCARD,"anagram of R PODCAST;  ‘Disguised’ is the anagrind.  POSTCARD for ‘message’?
"
1244,Dispossession notice given out around six,EVICTION,"anagram of NOTICE; around VI for ‘six’.  ‘Given out’ is the anagrind.
"
1245,Hid damaged desk from mother,MASKED,"A charade of MA and anagram of DESK; with ‘damaged’ as the anagrind.
"
1246,Imitation of epitaph’s unacceptable,RIP,"-OFFA charade of RIP (*Requiescat in Pace*) and OFF for ‘unacceptable’  (‘that’s a bit off’).  I wouldn’t say that a RIP-OFF was an ‘imitation’ though, and my Collins doesn’t give it; the SOED does however have ‘copy, plagiarise (slang)’.  And is the apostrophe s doing anything here?  For me, it’s suggesting that the answer should be RIPS OFF.
"
1247,Fine publication,DANDY,"A dd.  Everything’s fine and dandy; and the comic.  I think this is a tough ask for a five-letter solution with only two (not very helpful) crossing letters.
"
1248,One formerly known as Prince’s courage is shown in motorcycle races?,THE ARTIST,"An insertion of HEART IS in TT for the Isle of Man races.  The singer Prince changed his name to THE ARTIST.  Our first film – it was a silent one.

1249,Boy to embrace with love,HUGO,"A charade of HUG and O, and another 2011 release.
"
1250,Dim thing difficult to find when it’s dark,MIDNIGHT,"anagram of DIM THING;  ‘Difficult to find’ is the anagrind.  *Midnight in Paris* was another 2011 film, but I’m not sure if that’s what the setter intended.
"
1251,Republican with money problems?  Not exactly!,ROMNEY,"anagram of R MONEY;  ‘Problems’ is the anagrind.  Referring to Mitt Romney, the allegedly French-speaking Republican Presidential candidate, who’s not short of a few bob.
"
1252,In this Meryl’s heart’s not always in playing of hardline Tory?,THE IRON LADY,"Clever.  anagram of HA[R]DLINE TORY;  ‘Playing’ is the anagrind and Eimi’s inviting you to take R for the heart of MeRyl out of the anagram fodder.  Another of last year’s films, which starred Meryl Streep as the ageing Margaret Thatcher and outraged some hardline Tories.  I haven’t seen it, so I couldn’t possibly comment.  Let’s just say that when the day arrives, I won’t be voting for a state funeral …
"
1253,Closed before closing time in drinks fiascos,LASH,"-UPSI was hoping this would come to me when writing up the blog and it has (I think).  It’s an insertion of SHU[T] for ‘closed’ without the closing T for ‘time’ in LAPS for ‘drinks’.  LASH-UPS are ‘fiascos’.
"
1254,Traveller in Italian capital going over Beethoven’s Piano Concerto in E-flat major,EMPEROR,"A reversal (‘going over’) of REP in ROME for the Emperor Piano Concerto, Beethoven’s last.
"
1255,Car held by driving school helps attendants,BRIDESMAIDS,"An insertion of RIDE in BSM, British School of Motoring, then AIDS.  Another film.  Is the BSM still going?
"
1256,Senior citizen cooking almond,OLD MAN,"anagram of ALMOND;
"
1257,Veteran soldier’s not so good without a right hand,WARHORSE,"An insertion of A and RH in WORSE gives us our next film.
"
1258,Nail the source of “Let the train take the strain”,BRAD,"A BRAD is a ‘thin, flat, small-headed nail’ (SOED) and although I personally can’t remember it, I am guessing that ‘Let the train take the strain’  was a promotional phrase for British Railways in the heady days when the railways were nationalised and you could buy a ticket cheaply and easily rather than having to spend a fortune and a fortnight online trying to find the best price.  Anyway, it would have been a BR AD(vertisement).  Brad Pitt, of course, but I don’t know if that’s part of the film theme.
"
1259,Thirst for beers and Tango contained here in the Middle East,PALESTINE,"An insertion of ALES and T for Tango from the phonetic alphabet in PINE for ‘thirst for’.
"
1260,Stumped by simple-minded person’s landing,STAIRHEAD,"A charade of ST for the cricketing abbreviation and AIRHEAD to give you another word for the landing on a flight of stairs.
"
1261,Source of illumination in the long run,NEON LIGHT,"anagram of IN THE LONG; with ‘run’ as the anagrind.  Good spot.
"
1262,Supporter of unusual intelligence,LINTEL,"Hidden in unusuaL INTELligence.
"
1263,Celebrity set fair to appear regularly,STAR,"The odd letters of SeT fAiR.
"
1264,One character in Western having a setback – what a pity!,SHAME,"I can tell you that it’s another 2011 film, but how the clue works, I haven’t the foggiest.
"
1265,Woman Frayn finally cast in Donkeys’ Years,AGNES,"An insertion of N for the last letter of Frayn in AGES.  *Donkeys’ Years* is indeed a play written by Michael Frayn.
"
1266,"Sweet-scented flower originated around Slovakia, below embankment",DAMASK ROSE,"A charade of DAM for ’embankment’ and an insertion of SK for the internet domain code for Slovakia in AROSE.  I only discovered recently (through a crossword, natch) that the material DAMASK is so-called because of its links with Damascus, the Syrian capital, and it seems that the DAMASK ROSE may have similar origins.  What is happening in Syria at the moment is, sadly, anything but ‘sweet-scented’.
"
1267,Hormone replacement treatment of ailment’s working internally,MELATONIN,"An insertion of ON for ‘working’ in anagram of AILMENT; with ‘replacement treatment’ as the anagrind.  MELATONIN is the hormone implicated in mammalian circadian rhythms.
"
1268,Reformed sea dog now in perfect condition,GOOD AS NEW,"anagram of SEA DOG NOW;
"
1269,One regulation I’d overturned for festival,DIWALI,"A reversal of I LAW I’D to give you one version of the Hindu festival of light.  DEWALI, DIVALI and DEEPAVALI are your other options.  From the Sanskrit *dipavali*, ‘row of lights’, if you’re remotely interested.
"
1270,Liberal involved in distasteful widespread praise,GLORY,"An insertion of L in GORY.
"
1271,To be found in MDMA compound,AMIDE,"‘Compound’ is the definition: it’s a charade of AMID for ‘to be found in’ and E for Ecstasy, which is the street name for MDMA, or 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine.  AMIDES are compounds which contain a CONH2 group.

"
1274,Property propositions,PREMISES,"A dd.

"
1277,A charming French accent,ACUTE,"A plus CUTE to give you *l’accent aigu*, like in the word *été* for summer (which occasionally comes up in crosswords).
"

"
1279,Irritable about intelligence surrounding large ship,CANTANKEROUS,"A three-part clue: Everyman’s asking you to put together CA for circa or ‘about’ and NOUS for ‘intelligence’, and then put TANKER in the middle of it.
"
1280,Old English weapon found in barracks by Welsh river,QUARTERSTAFF,"A charade of QUARTERS for ‘barracks’ and TAFF for the Welsh river that flows through Cardiff among other places.  I was stuck for a bit trying to fit in AVON or AFON for the Welsh river.  ‘A stout pole, six to eight feet long and frequently iron-tipped, formerly used as a weapon by the English peasantry’ (SOED) and the second of the words with which I was unfamiliar.
"
1281,Dropped charges causing one to cry,SHED TEARS,"A charade of SHED for ‘dropped’ and TEARS for ‘charges (around)’.
"
1282,One identifies bishop and rook pocketed by child,MITRE,"Nicely misleading surface: I was trying to insert B and R into something.  It’s just an insertion of R for ‘rook’ in MITE, though.
"
1283,Some characters in healthy Droitwich spa,HYDRO,"Hidden in healtHY DROitwich.
"
1284,Deteriorate? Manage to consult foremost of doctors,RUN TO SEED,"Nice surface.  RUN for ‘manage’, then TO, SEE and D for the first letter of ‘doctors’.

"
1294,American rustic – fine example by pub on line,CRACKER,"-BARRELThe third term I wasn’t familiar with, and I got stuck trying to fit in BARROW for the second element (BAR on ROW), but the crossers sorted it out eventually.  It’s CRACKER for ‘fine example’, BAR for ‘pub’, RE for ‘on’ and L for ‘line’.  The SOED gives the definition ‘homespun’.
"
1295,Maturity shown by a deckhand originally guarding hold out at sea,ADULTHOOD,"A and D for the first letter of ‘deckhand’ with an insertion anagram of ‘guarding’) of (HOLD OUT; with ‘at sea’ as the anagrind.

"
1309,"Where old king may receive equitable treatment on the way to Oxford, say?",OFFA,"I wouldn’t fancy overseas solvers understanding this one.  OFFA was a King of Mercia and is best-remembered for the dyke he had built to keep the Welsh at bay.  But nowadays, it’s also the Office For Fair Access, a comparatively new government department charged with ensuring equality of access to all universities, irrespective of the type of school you went to or your socio-economic background.  However, it’s mostly been in the news for its comments about Oxbridge admissions, which is why Glow-worm has referenced that in the clue.
"
1310,"Pliant chaps, tense in addition",SUPPLEMENT,"A charade of SUPPLE, MEN and T for (grammatical) ‘tense’.
"
1311,Some mercurial celebrity’s rejected cake,ECLAIR,"Hidden reversed in mercuRIAL CElebrity.  In French, as well as being the cake, *un éclair* is a flash of lightning, but how – or indeed if – the two are related, I don’t know.
"
1312,Mister Satie more imperfectly played,ATOMISER,"It took me nearly as long for this as the rest of the puzzle put together, and I wasn’t helped by the fact that this, and MOIRÉ, which I also couldn’t see, intersected.  The surface is referencing Erik Satie, the French composer, but the definition is ‘mister’ and it’s anagram of SATIE MOR[E];  ‘Imperfectly’ is suggesting the removal of the last letter of ‘more’ and ‘played’ is the anagrind.
"
1313,Gobbles ice creams (about a score),CONSUMES,"An insertion of SUM in CONES.
"
1314,Supplier receives payment on last of concrete in drive,FEEDER,"A charade of FEE followed by an insertion of E for the last letter of ‘concrete’ in DR for ‘drive’.  FEEDER in the sense of a bird feeder or a feeder club for a Premier League team.

"
1316,"Plants catnip, oddly, under bottomless container",CACTI,"CA[N] plus CTI for the odd letters of CaTnIp.  Topless Serbs, bottomless containers … Glow-worm’s certainly keen on his letter removals.
"
1317,"Feature of bridge, when holding ace, is to make the first move!",PIONEER,"An insertion of ONE in PIER.
"
1318,Thoughts of fitting new kitchens and means of paying for them?,INSTALMENT PLANS,"A dd, with the second definition being what our Mam would have called the ‘never-never’.
"
1319,Fill out form for Department and send it,DISTEND,"anagram of D SEND IT; I think, but ‘form’ as an anagrind?
"
1320,Where ups and downs (and location of loos) feature?,RELIEF MAP,"A punning type of clue: if a map showed you where the toilets were, it might be a RELIEF MAP.
"
1321,Hollow performance put up under Cameron’s leadership is loudly mocked …,CATCALLED,"A reversal of DELL and ACT under CA for the first two letters of ‘Cameron’.  ‘Leadership’ to indicate the first two letters rather than just the first is a trick that not every solver is madly in love with.  Shocked anti-libertarians can queue up to comment below; those shocked by Cameron’s leadership can laud the surface.
"
1322,top fiasco developing thereby,IPSO FACTO,"anagram of TOP FIASCO;  with ‘developing’ as the anagrind for the Latin phrase meaning ‘thereby’.  And as is almost always the case, the ellipses can be safely ignored.
"
1323,"Given Falstaff’s nightcaps, perhaps, they collapse in the foyer!",OPERA HATS,"Falstaff is the opera by Verdi and OPERA HATS have the facility to collapse to make them easier to carry.
"
1324,Remedy for New Orleans twang?,NOSTRUM,"A charade of NO and STRUM.
"
1325,Scold Just William for being patriotic,TELL OFF,"‘Scold’ is the definition and I’m guessing it’s to do with William Tell, but I can’t see it beyond that, so help appreciated.
"
1326,Watered port drunk up by Glow-worm,MOIR,"ÉWell, the port (reversed) pretty much had to be RIO and Glow-worm had to be ME, but I had to persuade myself that the word existed.  ‘Of silk: watered’ (SOED).
"
1327,Relative variation in incidence new detectives missed,NIECE,"More letter removal: it’s anagram of I[NCID]ENCE;  with ‘variation’ as the anagrind.
"
1328,Kind of red figures that count?,CARDINAL NUMBERS,"A charade of the vivid red colour and NUMBERS.  I wasn’t that keen on this clue; it kind of works, but …
"
1329,Strange thing to see in place of evening entertainment,NIGHTSPOT,"A charade of anagram of NIGHT; and SPOT, with ‘strange’ as the anagrind.
"
1330,Time in the middle of the day to get off,NOT ON,"A synonym for ‘off’ in an insertion of T in NOON.
"
1331,Re-let a new building that’s permanent,ETERNAL,"anagram of RE-LET A N; with ‘building’ as the anagrind.
"
1332,Artist’s fiddle almost conjures up this Italian dish,RAVIOLI,"A charade of RA for ‘artist’ and VIOLI[N].
"
1333,Some of the better audio accessories for the period,ERA,"Hidden in bettER Audio.
"
1334,Poor intelligence produces unfortunate reports,BAD NEWS,"A charade of BAD for ‘poor’ and NEWS for ‘intelligence’, but the clue is barely cryptic, in my opinion, because ‘unfortunate’ and ‘reports’ are close synonyms of the first two words in the clue.
"
1335,Unending generosity by model with the greatest capacity,LARGEST,"A charade of LARGES[SE] and T for the Model T Ford.
"
1336,It’s about teams’ lives,RESIDES,"A charade of RE and SIDES.
"
1337,Leading light let off alarm …,STARTLE,"A charade of STAR and anagram of LET; with ‘off’ as the anagrind.
"
1338,the day before in Madame Veronique,EVE,"Hidden in MadamE VEronique.  As usual, the ellipses are irrelevant.
"
1339,Head of unique stud?,THE BOSS,"A (not very) cd.  A ‘stud’ is a boss, and if it was unique it would be THE BOSS rather than A BOSS.
"
1340,"Males do, unfortunately, employ an old word for a maid",DAMOSEL,"anagram of MALES DO; with ‘unfortunately’ as the anagrind.  It couldn’t be anything else, but it’s not a word I’d come across before: dictionaries give it as an alternative spelling of DAMSEL, which comes from the French *Mademoiselle*, ‘my lady/my girl’.  Interestingly, several municipalities in France have recently decided to drop this appellation, referring in correspondence to women of all ages as *Madame*.
"
1341,"Doesn’t gain a pound, initially, on seafood, even salmon",LOSES,"This is L for ‘pound’ (Libra) and the first letters of the last four words of the clue.
"
1342,In winter I’ve organised a question and answer session,INTERVIEW,"anagram of IN WINTER I’VE;
"
1343,Top actors with lines in Old Glory,STARS AND STRIPES,"A (not very well-hidden) dd.  ‘Old Glory’ is another name for the US flag.
"
1344,Stories told from from Pilgrims’ Progress to a place in Kent,CANTERBURY TALES,"Again, a barely hidden answer.  Bunyan’s book is actually called *The Pilgrim’s Progress*, but the clue is referring you to Chaucer’s work, where the pilgrims travelled from Southwark to Canterbury.  *Whan that aprill with his shoures soote, The droghte of march hath perced to the roote*, and all that.
"
1345,Scoundrel’s uniform drenched in dreadful gore,ROGUE,"An insertion of U for ‘uniform’ in the phonetic alphabet in anagram of GORE; with ‘dreadful’ as the anagrind.
"
1346,"Fashionable present, for example, that’s great",INTENSE,"A charade of IN for ‘fashionable’ and TENSE, for present in the grammatical sense.
"
1347,Phials for first of urine sample misplaced,AMPULES,"Again, another alternative spelling.  Modern English has AMPOULES, but the SOED gives this as an alternative spelling, but marks it as ‘rare or obsolete’.  It’s anagram of U SAMPLE;.
"
1348,Unaffected note,NATURAL,"A dd.  The ‘note’ is of the musical variety, in other words not a sharp or a flat.
"
1349,"Short skirt, very short, with fur trimming",MINIVER,"A charade of MINI and VER[Y].   ‘A kind of fur used as a trimming in ceremonial dress’ (SOED).
"
1350,New text about traveller being sociable,EXTROVERT,"An insertion of ROVER in anagram of TEXT; with ‘new’ as the anagrind.
"
1351,"Little time, when inn’s closed, perhaps, for a song from a show",SEND IN THE CLOWNS,"anagram of T WHEN INN’S CLOSED;  ‘Perhaps’ is the anagrind.  I have always known the song from Judy Collins’ version of it, but it does indeed come from a Steven Sondheim musical.
"
1352,Complaint about Daisy’s Personal Equity Plan,DYSPEPSIA,"The posh word for gut-ache is anagram of DAISY’S PEP; with ‘about’ as the anagrind.
"
1353,Small Scotch,WEE,"A cd.

1354,Worker produced article on time,ANT,"A charade of AN and T.
"
1355,Searches for water right inside but drifts off,DROWSES,"An insertion of R inside DOWSES.
"
1356,Sitting with one’s half-sister arranged,SESSION,"anagram of ONE’S SIS; with ‘arranged’ as the anagrind.
"
1357,Sober son administers drugs,SEDATES,"A charade of SEDATE for ‘sober’ and S for ‘son’.
"
1358,Fan married unhappily,ADMIRER,"anagram of MARRIED;
"
1359,Spare metre put in waste container,SKIMP,"An insertion of M in SKIP.
"
1360,Second player in line of defence?,BACK,"A dd.
"
1361,"A boy in plan starts to think everything difficult, being unsuited to task?",MALADAPTED,"An insertion of A LAD in MAP followed by TED for the first letters of ‘think everything difficult’.
"
1362,Critic and editor returned by vehicle rarely seen in city streets,DETRACTOR,"A reversal of ED and TRACTOR, which is a vehicle not often seen in city streets, except in Paris when the farming community is objecting to cuts in the Common Agricultural Policy budget and is dumping manure outside the relevant ministry.
"
1363,This is not detected – odd sound,THRUM,"I liked this one.  A charade of TH[IS] and RUM for ‘odd’.  I had a look in the SOED to check the definition and it’s  ‘a sound of a guitar being strummed’, but there are a number of other meanings, including ‘copulate’.  I love English.
"
1364,Agitated cop in race riot returning the same gestures?,RECIPROCATION,"anagram of COP IN RACE RIOT; with ‘agitated’ as the anagrind.
"
1365,Angry speeches that could be staider,TIRADES,"anagram of STAIDER;  ‘Could be’ is the anagrind.
"
1366,River swirling for example with problem getting across,GANGES,"One of those clues where, for me at least, once you’d got the crossing letters ‘it has to be that’, but where it took a while to parse.  I am ready to be corrected, but I think it works with two reversal indicators: ‘swirling’ and ‘getting across’ for an insertion of GE (reversal of EG for ‘for example’) in GANS (reversal of SNAG for ‘problem’).
"
1367,Flowery things provided by pupil up in school,LUPINS,"Hidden in pupiL UP IN School
"
1368,Artist has to put up with squalid room,RATHOLE,"A charade of RA and THOLE.  Only a couple of pages back in the SOED from THRUM for me to check THOLE: ‘ suffer, undergo, be afflicted with’.
"
1369,Seem classy and hep wandering round elegant thoroughfare in Paris,CHAMPS ELYSEES,"anagram of SEEM CLASSY HEP; with a clearly indicated anagram (‘wandering’) for the avenue in the *huitième arrondissement* whose name comes originally from Greek.
"
1370,You may see a fierce contest in Somerset tomorrow,SET,"-TOHidden in SomerSET TOmorrow.
"
1371,"Find goal ultimately with difficulty, striking around when this?",BLINDFOLD,"An insertion anagram of ‘around’) of (FIND L; in BOLD for ‘striking’.  ‘With difficulty’ is the anagrind.
"
1372,Head is comic but lacking in love,BEAN,"BEAN[O] with the O for ‘love’ removed from the comic that (still) features Dennis the Menace and Minnie the Minx.  BEAN is slang for ‘head’.
"
1373,American pal with little energy gets seaside location,BUDE,"A charade of BUD for the American word for ‘pal’ with E to give you the Cornish resort.  Perhaps the mark of a gentler puzzle that the setter clues it as ‘little energy’ for E.
"
1374,Someone needed for party?  There’s double hesitation after dodgy act,CATERER,"Two lots of hesitation, ER, ER, after anagram of ACT;  ‘Dodgy’ is the anagrind.
"
1375,Mixed contents of pan – taste as something to whet the appetite,ANTEPAST,"anagram of PAN TASTE; with ‘mixed contents’ as the anagrind.  An (archaic, according to the SOED) alternative to ANTIPASTO, the Italian term for ‘starter’ or ‘appetiser’; etymologically ‘before the meal’.
"
1376,Ventilation system made of a metal that gets cold inside,AIR,"-CONAn insertion of C for ‘cold’ in A IRON for ‘a metal’.
"
1377,"I’d pain at heart, revolting against cruel political regime",ANTI,"-APARTHEIDanagram of I’D PAIN AT HEART; with ‘revolting’ as the anagrind.
"
1378,Deviation of indeterminate number grasped by mathematician,TURNING,"An insertion of N for the mathematical representation of ‘indeterminate number’ in Alan TURING, the mathematician widely regarded as the father of computer science who worked at Bletchley Park during the war and committed suicide, possibly because of his being prosecuted for being homosexual, in 1954.
"
1379,It’s not bright in one small building that’s run down,DIMINISHED,"A clever charade of DIM, IN, I and SHED.
"
1380,Somehow reconnect iPad that’s likely to crash?,ACCIDENT,"-PRONEanagram of RECONNECT IPAD; with ‘somehow’ as the anagrind.  Quixote wouldn’t have been able to get iPad into one of his clues when he started out in the Indy all those years ago, and I guess it’s a product that wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for the man referenced in 7 down.
"
1381,"Put little son in a high bed before start of supper, whatever may happen",AT ALL COSTS,"An insertion of S in A TALL COT before another S for the first letter of ‘supper’.  S for an abbreviation of ‘son’ is very common, but like in 1dn, the setter’s giving us an extra bit of help by cluing it as ‘little son’.
"
1382,Granny is out to get part of the legal establishment,GRAYS INN,"anagram of GRANNY IS; with ‘out’ as the anagrind.
"
1383,Carriage taking Head of Art between pub and college,PHAETON,"An insertion of A for the first letter of ‘Art’ in PH for public house and ETON for the alma mater of our current Prime Minister.  And a word I only know from crosswords.
"
1384,No horse should be let loose towards the coast,ONSHORE,"Another anagram.  anagram of NO HORSE; with ‘should be let loose’ as the anagrind.  Quixote’s certainly been shuffling his Scrabble tiles today.
"
1385,Like some tea the woman served before dance ended prematurely,HERBAL,"A charade of HER and BAL[L].
"
1386,Port that could be a haunt of vice,ADEN,"Hello sailor!  A charade of A and DEN for the Yemeni port.
"
1387,Taking a month off planning Martinmas 6,MATINS,"An immediate reference to the gateway clue, SERVICE, of which MATINS is one.  Glow-worm’s inviting you to take the Mar for ‘month’ off ‘Martinmas’ and then make the anagram anagram of TINMAS;, with – I presume – ‘planning’ as the anagrind.  Unless someone has a better idea.
"
1388,Aftereffects of Afghan government’s retrenchement,HANGOVER,"Hidden n AfgHAN GOVERnment’s.
"
1389,"Sink a performance, admitting bad start in outskirts of Wirral",WASHBOWL,"An insertion of B for the first letter of ‘bad’ in A SHOW; then all inserted in WL for the first and last letters of ‘Wirral’.
"
1390,Utter pain with old shin guard,GREAVE,"Nothing to do with football this time.  A homophone of ‘grieve’, with ‘utter’ as the homophone indicator;  as in ‘it pains me/grieves me to say so …’  A new one on me, but the SOED confirms: ‘ A piece of armour for the leg, below the knee, especially the shin.’  It’s Middle English, which is why it’s ‘old’.
"
1391,Anxious twitch follows introduction of novel currency,NEUROTIC,"Well, as Sir Alex would say, it’s squeaky bum time in Greece at the moment with their ‘novel’ currency, the EURO.  Put N for the first letter of ‘novel’ in front of that, follow it by TIC and you’ve got your answer.
"
1392,Anzac regulars billeted in Miss Locket’s folly,LUNACY,"An insertion of NA for the even letters of ‘Anzac’ in LUCY.
"
1393,Lucy Locket lost her pocket;,K,"itty Fisher found it.*Not a penny was there in it,*
"
1394,I’d so welcome restaging for knockabout shows,LOW COMEDIES,"Another new one on me, but it couldn’t be anything else.  anagram of I’D SO WELCOME; with ‘restaging’ as the anagrind.
"
1395,Soup pot?,BISQUE,"A dd, I think.  BISQUE as a soup, I knew; it’s your shellfish, innit?  But the SOED also gives: ‘ In various games, especially tennis, croquet and golf (yawn) the allowing of a point or stroke to be scored or taken when desired as a handicapping advantage.’
"
1396,Everything there is unsettling in revues,UNIVERSE,"anagram of IN REVUES;
"
1397,Sausage I’m regrettably taking back …,SALAMI,"A reversal of I’M and ALAS.
"
1398,repeated problem with stone inside,INSISTED,"anagram of ST INSIDE; with ‘problem’ as the anagrind.
"
1399,Scheme isn’t largely captivating team’s top banana,PLANTAIN,"A type of banana is a charade of PLAN for ‘scheme’, AIN for most of AIN’T, surrounding T for the first letter of ‘team’.  You need to cook them, apparently, as a Caribbean colleague once told me that they are pretty inedible raw.  It comes from the Spanish for ‘banana’, *plátano*, which is an oddity: all the other main European languages (including Portuguese and Italian) have a cognate with ‘banana’: banan, Banane, banaan, or banana, which is apparently originally derived from a West African language.
"
1400,"Application reviewed in camera, with setter removed",ARNICA,"anagram of IN CA[ME]RA; with ‘reviewed’ as the anagrind and ME (‘the setter’) removed.  ARNICA is a lotion or cream that you apply to leg muscles that are aching after you’ve spent too long standing at first slip while the opposition batsmen have been mothering it relentlessly into the long grass.
"
1401,Song-and-dance partner’s state,PALAVER,"This was my last one in, and I got completely fixated on the idea that it must be CABARET, then went looking for a US state abbreviation to insert in something meaning ‘partner’.  But of course it’s simpler than that: a charade of PAL for ‘partner’ and AVER for ‘state’.  You have to take the apostrophe s to mean ‘has’ rather than ‘is’.
"
1402,So far the riot’s developing around the centre of Southwark,HITHERTO,"anagram of THE RIOT H;  ‘Developing’ is the anagrind and H is the central letter of ‘Southwark’.
"
1403,Squire’s wheels?,ESCORT,"This was head in dictionary time for me again.  It’s a dd: ‘wheels’ is slang for car, therefore ESCORT for those of us that are old enough to remember it (I passed my test in a Mark 1, which dates me); and the SOED also gives under ‘squire’ as a verb: ‘of a man, to escort a lady’.  So there you go.
"
1404,"Huddled, weapons raised, German called the shots",SNUGGLED,"A charade of GUNS reversed, G for ‘German’ and LED.
"
1405,Noble Henry’s last becoming girl – or an earlier one?,BOLEYN,"anagram of NOBLE Y; with ‘becoming’ as the anagrind gives you Anne BOLEYN, one of the six wives of Henry VIII, who parted company with her head in 1536; but she wasn’t the last, which is why the setter’s added the last four words to the clue.  Divorced, beheaded, died; divorced, beheaded, survived.
"
1406,"Victoria’s first seen in shot cerise and navy, for example",SERVICE,"The gateway clue, and an accessible one: it’s anagram of V CERISE; with ‘shot’ as the anagrind.  I got this one early on, but SERVICE could hint at lots of areas, so I needed one of the themed clues to be certain.
"
1407,sounding utterly normal around college,HOLY COMMUNION,"Our second SERVICE is a charade of HOLY for a homophone of ‘wholly’ or ‘utterly’ followed by an insertion of UNI for ‘college’ in COMMON for ‘normal’.
"
1408,Conductor of 6 starts to admit laxity with this kind of error,CLERICAL,"A charade of CLERIC for the man or woman who conducts the SERVICE and the first two letters of ‘admit’ and ‘laxity’.
"
1409,OG (not SN) 6?,EVENSONG,"I thought this was a bit of a strange clue.  EVENSONG is our third SERVICE, and it appears to be alluding to the fact that O and G are the ‘even’ letters of SONG, thus excluding the odd ones, S and N.
"
1410,For hamstring cold is a blessing in disguise,DISABLE,"Hidden in colD IS A BLEssing.
"
1411,German city church comes into being,ESSENCE,"A charade of ESSEN and CE.  Plenty of churchy stuff today.
"
1412,Picturesque and unusual antique missing foot,QUAINT,"anagram of ANTIQU[E]; with ‘unusual’ as the anagrind.
"
1413,Invest nearly everything at the end of the month,INSTAL,"A charade of INST for ‘the current month’ (although it’s really old fashioned: ‘we beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd inst’) and AL for ‘nearly’ ALL.  Although the setter could have left out the ‘nearly’ if he’d chosen to use the eight-letter alternative, INSTALL.
"
1414,"Prisoner, rich and spoilt, shackled by eye or dubious legal authority",POWER OF ATTORNEY,"A bit going on here: it’s a charade of POW anagram of Prisoner of War) and an insertion of FAT and TORN in (EYE OR;  ‘Dubious’ is the anagrind and ‘shackled’ is the insertion indicator.
"
1415,Tasty bird you might once have picked up?,PENGUIN,"Referring to the chocolate bar with the p-p-pick up a Penguin slogan.  Are they still going?  The ‘once’ suggests not.
"
1416,Popular leaders of Italy and Denmark forced into the world,INDUCED,"Nice misdirection: I’m guessing that most solvers, including me, had the urge to insert I and D into something meaning ‘world’.  But it’s IN for ‘popular’, then DUCE for ‘leaders of Italy’ and D for ‘Denmark’, with the answer referring to INDUCING a baby’s birth.
"
1417,Brickie’s helper knocked over – whoops!,DOH,"!Homer’s famous interjection is a reversal of HOD.  It’s been in the OED since 2001, so spelled, but I’ve also seen D’OH!  My only quibble is that if you’re a fan of *The Simpsons*, you will know that it’s generally used in frustration, when Homer has done something unbelievably stupid, whereas ‘whoops!’ is uttered if you’ve nearly had an accident.  Typical Homer quote: ‘You’ll have to speak up, I’m wearing a towel.’
"
1418,Legless round?  Thank pub crawl!,DRUNKATHON,"This, on the contrary, is not in my dictionaries, but I presume it’s a back-formation from MARATHON, meaning a serious pub crawl anagram of although presumably not the full 26 miles and 385 yards).  (ROUND THANK; with ‘legless’ as the anagrind.
"
1419,"Tease about record, as subject of musical",JOSEPH,"An insertion of EP for ‘Extended-Play’ record in JOSH, for the musical with the man in the technicolor dreamcoat.  I did see EP clued as ‘old record’ somewhere else recently, which I suppose is more accurate.
"
1420,Again prescribe ecstasy or first of drugs to put in water,REORDAIN,"An insertion of E OR D in RAIN.
"
1421,"Pour” appeal, short of a drink",TIPPLE,"A charade of TIP for ‘pour’ and PLE[A].
"
1422,"Moment of bewilderment as underwear hit by lightning, perhaps?",BRAINSTORM,"A pun on BRA IN STORM.  Wouldn’t be like Punk not to have ladies’ underwear in somewhere, would it?
"
1423,Epitaph bringing tear,RIP,"A dd.  *Requiescat in Pace* and ‘tear’ in its verbal sense.
"
1424,Gangster thus provided backing in communist,MAFIOSO,"A reversal of SO and IF in MAO, the old Chinese Chairman.
"
1425,Mocking about lightweight French leader,SARKOZY,"Not for much longer, if you believe the polls, although all 50kg of him is fighting back.  An insertion of OZ for ‘ounce’ in SARKY.
"
1426,No jack-of-all-trades is also perceived as flexible,OVERSPECIALISED,"anagram of IS ALSO PERCEIVED;
"
1427,"Transported by Tube, does one have 3.14 legs?",PIPED,"A whimsical way of suggesting that if a BIPED has two legs and a QUADRUPED has four legs, then a PIPED might have 3.14 legs, since 3.14 to two decimal figures is PI, the ratio of the the circumference of a circle to its diameter.  It’s an irrational number, which means that the digits after the decimal point go on forever without repeating.  An autistic savant holds the world record for reciting them from memory: he reached over 20,000 places.
"
1428,Arm lifts Queen into toy,WINCHESTER RIFLE,"A charade of WINCHES and an insertion of ER in TRIFLE.
"
1429,"Summary, marginally ahead in boxing bout?",ROUND,"-UPA cd cum dd.
"
1430,"Fine cooking expected, melted dish",FONDUE,"A further charade of F, ON for ‘cooking’ (‘the roast beef’s on’) and DUE to give you the (mainly cheesy) dish you dip your bread into.  It’s the feminine past participle, since you ask, of the French verb *fondre*, ‘to melt’.  It’s linked to English words like FOUNDRY, where steel is melted.
"
1431,Star does this act finally overcoming those picked out?,TWINKLE,"T for the last letter of acT and WINKLE, which lovers of seafood need to pick out of the shell with that little pin thingy.
"
1432,Sorted out about fifty?  He’s more experienced,OLDSTER,"anagram of SORTED L;  ‘Out’ is the anagrind.
"
1433,Radio personality discussing ministers going commando?,NICHOLAS PARSONS,"This was my joint favourite today.  For maiden aunts, I should explain that ‘going commando’ is the act of venturing out without wearing underpants or knickers (don’t ask).  So (presumably female) ministers or PARSONS would be ‘knickerless’, which is a homophone (‘discussing’) of NICHOLAS.  NICHOLAS PARSONS is the slightly smug radio presenter, probably best known for chairing *Just a Minute* on Radio 4.  He’s nearly as old as Araucaria, so there’s a good chance that you will have come across him, although overseas solvers might be a bit disadvantaged.
"
1434,"Eaten up by Chewbacca, doyen, Jedi master",YODA,"One for Star Wars fans.  Hidden reversed (‘up’) in ChewbaccA DOYen, YODA is indeed a Jedi master.
"
1435,Sex up joint attended by Quaker,KNEE,"-TREMBLERMy other joint favourite.  A charade of KNEE for ‘joint’ and TREMBLER for ‘Quaker’.  Again for the benefit of maiden aunts, a KNEE-TREMBLER is an act of human coitus performed in a position at 90 degrees from the missionary option, often with a nightclub wall for support; hence ‘sex up’.  We’ll move on.
"
1436,"Stick out, bearing fibre",JUTE,"A charade of JUT and E for East, a ‘bearing’.
"
1437,Sparkler – one gets used around the 5th of November,GEMSTONE,"I thought this was really clever, with a great surface.  It’s an insertion of M for the 5th letter of NoveMber in anagram of ONE GETS; with ‘used’ as the anagrind.
"
1438,Islanders b Irish upset a lot,BRITONS,"A charade of B, RI for ‘Irish upset’ and TONS.  I shall refrain from comment on the veracity of the surface.
"
1439,"Timeless, timeless, sick",IMMORAL,"IMMOR[T]AL.
"
1440,Little plants – a social climber climbs one,BONSAI,"The Japanese culturing of miniature plants is a charade of A SNOB for ‘a social climber’ reversed (‘climbs’) and I for ‘one’.
"
1441,Home you occupied that’s waterproofed,PAYED,"An insertion of YE for ‘you’ in PAD for ‘home’ to give you the past tense of the verb ‘to pay’, one of whose meanings is ‘to waterproof’, I learned today (‘mainly nautical’, according to the SOED).
"
1442,"Shells, say in stream, molluscs",AMMO,"Hidden in streAM MOlluscs.
"
1443,Like seabird behind a boat,ASTERN,"A charade of AS for ‘like’ and TERN.
"
1444,Royal Navy?,BLUE,"I think this is referring to the fact that royals are ‘blue-blooded’, and of course navy BLUE is a colour.  The question mark just about rescues it, I think.
"
1445,Can’t be holed,UNSINKABLE,"Is this cryptic?  I’m with Mark Twain on golf, by the way.
"
1446,"s fate, uncharacteristically!",A DROP IN THE OCEAN,"Well, clearly this is what happened to the Titanic, but what the ‘uncharacteristically’ is doing, I can’t say.  Is it trying to indicate that the Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable?
"
1447,Places in office where 19 aimed to be,INSTATES,"INSTATE is a verb meaning to ‘put in office’ (*cf* RE-INSTATE) and IN STATES is where the Titanic was meant to end up.
"
1448,Scruffy drunk empties pockets,UNKEMPT,"Nicely hidden in drUNK EMPTies.
"
1449,Director of romance at sea?,CAMERON,"Referring to James Cameron, director of the Titanic movie.  It’s anagram of ROMANCE; with ‘at sea’ as the anagrind, and is an &lit or ‘all-in-one’ clue, where the whole clue suggests the solution.
"
1450,Dish of shellfish acquiring a central Paris following,CALAMARI,"Nice surface.  The setter’s inviting you to insert A into CLAM and then follow it with ARI, the central letters of ‘Paris’.
"
1451,Show embarrassment in Communist hideout,REDDEN,"A simple charade of RED and DEN.
"

"

"
1455,Hear my reaction to Halloween trick or treat,ICE CREAM,"Another cleverly put together surface.  It’s a homophone (‘hear’) of I SCREAM.

"
1460,Enigma resolved by a cure for indigestion,MAGNESIA,"Milk of MAGNESIA is a anagram of rather old-fashioned now) cure for dyspepsia, but I think the clue is faulty.  The way it reads is (ENIGMA; plus A with ‘resolved’ as the anagrind.  But there’s no S in the anagram fodder, which makes me think that it should have been ‘Enigma’s resolved …’
"
1461,"Burnt tea, as reported to general",BR,"ÛLÉEAs in *crème brûlée*.  It’s a homophone (‘as reported’) of BREW and General Robert E LEE, the setters’ General of choice because of his helpful surname.  And *brûler* is indeed the French for ‘to burn’.

"
1463,Burden after maiden perhaps put on too much weight,OVERLOAD,"A charade of an OVER in cricket where no runs are scored and LOAD, and perhaps another themed reference?
"
1464,"It hit an iceberg largely concealed, dropping headfirst",TITANIC,"The gateway clue, and to be fair, it’s a giveaway from the definition.  It’s hidden in iT [H]IT AN ICeberg.  The setter’s asking you to remove the H as the first letter of ‘head’.  And it is a good surface.
"
1465,I need a translation of Latin poem,AENEID,"anagram of I NEED A; for Virgil’s poem.
"
1466,Right part of cow is provided to steer,RUDDER,"A charade of R and UDDER.  Another clever surface and another nautical reference.

"
1483,Complex calculations made by anaesthetist? Crisis in middle of surgery,NUMBER CRUNCHING,"I liked this one specially.  It’s NUMBER for ‘anaesthetist’ (because he numbs you), CRUNCH for ‘crisis’, IN, and G for the middle letter of ‘surgery’.

"
1503,Suggestion to bring misgiving?,SUSPICION,"A dd.  In the first meaning, it’s as a ‘hint’ or ‘touch’ ; or indeed a soupçon, which comes from the French *soupçonner*, ‘to suspect’.
"

1506,Shades – what you may find in high-class gents outfitters?,NICETIES,"A punning clue of NICE TIES.
"
1507,Yesteryear’s footballer concealing silver hair,PELAGE,"Here’s the first of our people: it’s an insertion of AG for ‘silver’ in PELÉ (better known as Edson Arantes do Nascimento), possibly the most gifted footballer of his generation.  Not too common a word, perhaps, but ‘the coat of a mammal, consisting of hair, wool, fur, etc’ .  It’s of Latin, then French origin, and is related to words like PELT and DEPILATION, which might or might not have helped you.
"

"

"
1510,I arraign guy – fancy fellow not seeing God up above the sky!,YURI GAGARIN,"anagram of I ARRAIGN GUY; with ‘fancy’ as the anagrind and our second person.  It took me a long time to put this one in, even though it was a well-signposted anagram.  At first, I couldn’t understand the last part of the clue, but a quick flirt online tells me that the first man in space is quoted as saying ‘I looked and looked but I couldn’t see God’.
"
1511,"How father behaves, the man twitching inside?  A number here may appear this way!  (15)",PARENTHETICALLY,"I had quite a few crossing letters and a good few guesses at the others before I saw this, and it made me smile.  It’s an insertion of HE and TIC in PARENTALLY.  It’s cleverly referring to the fact that the enumeration of crossword clues is given at the end of the clue, in parentheses – in this case, (15).  My CoD.
"
1512,Dog food given to a new one of five born in litter,PALANQUIN,"I fancied that this might be a carriage of some sort, but the list in my thesaurus didn’t give this one.  It’s clear cluing of an unusual word: PAL (‘dog food’), A, N and QUIN.  ‘A covered litter carried on the shoulder of four men.’  This one comes from Portuguese.  English hasn’t half scavenged some words over the centuries.

"
1517,A mathematical unit that’s little short of brilliant,RADIAN,"And another.  RADIAN[T].  A RADIAN is the angle between two radii of a circle that cut off on the circumference an arc equal to that of the radius of the circle.  I did used to know that, honest, but I will fess up to having to look it up to check.

"
1519,"Quiet message of reassurance from best man, trembling",SHIVERING,"I did like this one: it’s SH for ‘quiet!’ and I’VE RING, which is what every groom wants to hear once up there waiting for the bride to make her entrance.
"

"
1522,Like special crossword in which you’ll find holiday islands,THEMED,"A dd.  Mr M in this avatar doesn’t often do THEMED crosswords (although Pasquale did give us a TEST MATCH SPECIAL last month in Another Place), and of course you’d find holiday islands in THE MED(ITERRANEAN).
"
1523,Brief experience – avoid a second time – it’s a shocker!,TASER,"And another removal.  TAS[T]ER, with Quixote asking you to remove the second T, to give you the stun gun. I thought it might be an acronym, but it’s just a trade name.
"
1524,British criminal in violent robbery?,BLAG,"A charade of B and LAG, a slang definition of our prisoner in 15ac (although I think it’s only a term in British English).  A definition I didn’t know: ‘ a robbery, esp with violence’.
"
1525,Upset but extremely ladylike after son’s slight,SUBTLE,"A three-part charade: S for ‘son’, UBT for ‘but’ upset, and LE for the outer letters of LadylikE.
"
1526,Spooner’s group spoils game,HANDBALL,"It’s just me, but Spooner clues are not my favourites, because you get into discussions about whether you’re swapping the first letters, or the first syllables, or whatever.  But this is pretty clear: BAND for ‘group’ and HAUL for ‘spoils’ given the good Reverend’s treatment.
"
1527,Transferred target man for brawling,TERMAGANT,"anagram of TARGET MAN; with ‘transferred’ as the anagrind.  TERMAGANT can apparently be used as an adjective as well as a noun.
"
1528,Approaches essential to linear systems,NEARS,"Hidden in liNEAR Systems.
"
1529,River goddess,ISIS,"A dd.  The Thames at Oxford and the Egyptian goddess.  Don’t know whether that’s where river name came from.

"
1531,American actress goes after Chrissie’s first racket,CLAMOUR,"A charade of C and LAMOUR for the American actress Dorothy LAMOUR, perhaps best known for her roles in the *Road to* … movies.  I suspect the misdirection with ‘Chrissie’s’ is referring to Chris(sie) Evert, the American tennis player.

"
1533,"Threaten, in French, to break this symbol of authority",MENACE,"An insertion of EN for one of the words in French for ‘in’, in MACE, the ceremonial symbol of authority.  There’s one in the House of Commons, and those old enough will remember that Michael Heseltine got a bag on in 1976 and started waving it about during a debate.  I think he got hoyed out of the Commons for a bit because of this.
"
1534,Peace finally after prince gets old French duke to yield,PRODUCE,"Another multi-part charade: PR for ‘prince’, O for ‘old’, DUC for ‘French duke’ and E for the last letter of ‘peacE’.  ‘Yield’ is the definition.  Good surface.
"
1535,Awful lie involving student spread around before you put your foot in it,ESPADRILLE,"The sandal, into which you put your foot, is anagram of SPREAD; then anagram of L LIE;  The two anagrinds are ‘awful’ and ‘around’, and it’s L for ‘learner’ or ‘student’.

"
1540,Fellow getting spiritual illumination in Exodus,FLIGHT,"A charade of F and LIGHT.
"
1541,"Plant gun in a corner, perhaps",SET PIECE,"I did like this once I’d had the pdm.  It’s a charade of SET for ‘plant’ or ‘put’ and PIECE for ‘gun’.  And of course a corner in football is a SET PIECE.
"
1542,An obstruction to prevent the retreat of Irish rebel,BARRICADE,"Yet another multi-parter: BAR is ‘to prevent’, RI is the abbreviation for ‘Irish’ reversed, and Jack CADE, the Man of Kent/Kentish Man who led a rebellion against Henry VI.  I only knew the last bit because it came up in another puzzle recently.  One to file away, I fancy.
"
1543,Guide shows initiative,LEAD,"The effortlessness with which the English language can have the same word as a noun or verb is at the root of this clue.  ‘I will LEAD you; I will guide you.’  ‘I will take the LEAD; I will take the initiative.’
"
1544,He leaves without feeling ingenuous,ARTLESS,"[HE]ARTLESS.
"
1545,Symbol of French belief about the central features of capitalism,DENOTATION,"Plenty of français aujourd’hui.  DE for ‘of’ in French, then an insertion of TA for the central letters of ‘capiTAlism’ in NOTION for ‘belief’.

"
1549,Occasionally referring to uprising when going around with Tunisia’s leader,NOW AND THEN,"Okay, I have looked at this long enough.  ‘Occasionally’ is the definition, but I can’t parse it, so help appreciated.
"
1550,Moneypenny’s dumped in launch as it’s abandoned,FOUNDLING,"You might as well have two in a row you can’t explain.  Launch is founding, I guess, and a FOUNDLING is a baby that’s abandoned in a safe place, but where Moneypenny comes into it I can’t see.  I’m not being much help to you this morning, am I?
"
1551,Forceful macho types kept in check,VEHEMENT,"Clever clue.  An insertion of HE MEN in VET.
"
1552,An abstract of mine getting an award after European exhibition’s opening,EPITOME,"‘A summary or abstract of a written work’ (SOED).  E for ‘European’ PIT for ‘mine’, OM for ‘Order of Merit’ and E for the first letter of ‘exhibition’.
"
1553,Cultivated it among staff,POLITE,"An insertion of IT in POLE.
"
1554,Priest in silence retreating behind small partition,SEPTUM,"The definition is ‘partition’, particularly in the biological sense and even more particularly in the cardiac SEPTUM sense.  There haven’t half been some multi-part clues in this one: S for ‘small’, then an insertion of P for ‘priest’ in MUTE, ‘silence’ reversed.
"
1555,Courage lacking at first in Shakespearean character,PLUCK,"An insertion of L for the first letter of ‘lacking’ in PUCK, one of the characters in Shakespeare’s *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*.  Aka Robin Goodfellow and an Indy setter.

"
1559,He guides Home Secretary crossing wood on island,HELMSMAN,"An insertion of ELM in HS followed by the Isle of MAN.  Not sure I’ve seen HS as an abbreviation for ‘Home Secretary’ before, but I’m sure it’s in a dictionary somewhere.
"
1560,Plug opening at sea,ADRIFT,"A charade of AD for advertisement or ‘plug’ and RIFT for ‘opening’.
"
1561,Suitable place husband’s found in Ulster church,NICHE,"An insertion of H for ‘husband’ in NI for ‘Ulster’ and CE for ‘church’.  Northern Ireland and Ulster are of course not the same thing, but that doesn’t stop setters presuming that they are.
"
1562,Bush able to act cunningly,BOX CLEVER,"Nice surface, although I fancy George Dubya didn’t have sufficient intelligence to do cunning.  A charade of BOX for the bush or shrub, and CLEVER for ‘able’.

"
1564,Consequence of queen backing action of strikers,REPERCUSSION,"A reversal of ER for ‘queen’ and PERCUSSION, which is the action of drummers, or ‘strikers’.

"
1567,Flash Gordon’s third jacket,BLAZER,"Took me a while to see this one.  It’s a charade of BLAZE for ‘flash’ and R for the third letter of Gordon.  What some solvers refer to as a ‘lift and separate’ clue, I think.
"
1568,Amateur team includes a reserve,LAY ASIDE,"AN insertion of A in LAY for ‘amateur’ and SIDE for ‘team’.  This sense of LAY is probably most often heard in ‘lay preacher’.
"
1569,Ruins King’s broadcast,WRECKS,"I liked this one.  It’s a homophone (‘broadcast’) of Rex, the Latin word for ‘King’.

1580,Weapon for shooting Spooner’s top bird?,CROSSBOW,"Not my favourite type of clue, but Nutmeg’s made this one work well: the ‘top bird’ would be a BOSS CROW.
"
1581,Capable of meeting with it,UP TO DATE,"The definition is ‘with it’, and I presume that the setter is suggesting that if you are UP TO DATE, you are capable of meeting a deadline, but I am happy for someone to disabuse me of this line of thought.

"
1593,Fish steak prepared,SKATE,"anagram of STEAK;
"
1594,Doctor returning to northern college,GIRTON,"A reversal of RIG for ‘doctor’, TO, and N for ‘northern’ gives you the Cambridge College, which used to be all-female, but became co-educational in 1976.  Girton undergraduates tend to be among the fittest at the University, since the college is some way from the City centre where most lectures are held, so cycling in and back each day gets their cardiovascular system going.
"
1595,Decidedly fashionable black suit,IN SPADES,"‘Decidedly’ is the definition: it’s a charade of IN for ‘fashionable’ and SPADES for ‘black suit’.  Another lovely surface.

1601,"Rise to heaven, the home of the greater gods",MOUNT OLYMPUS,"I think Everyman is simply referring here to the fact that to ‘rise to heaven’ you’d have to MOUNT OLYMPUS, but perhaps someone has a better idea.
"
1602,Writers having a drink in a US city,PENSACOLA,"A charade of PENS for ‘writers’, A and COLA for the city in Florida.  Another lovely surface reading.
"
1603,Tins are wrong for a wine,RETSINA,"anagram of TINS ARE;  One of the most disgusting variants of alcohol I’ve ever tasted.  It’s right popular with crossword compilers, though, because it’s also anagram of RETAINS; anagram of RETINAS; anagram of NASTIER; anagram of INTERS A; anagram of INSERT A; anagram of NEAR ITS; and anagram of EARN ITS;  I think it deserves some kind of award.
"
1604,"Daughter, having drunk rye after rum, becomes unsteady",DODDERY,"A charade of D for ‘daughter’, ODD for ‘rum’ and anagram of RYE;  ‘Drunk’ is the anagrind, and it’s another well-crafted surface.
"
1605,"One-armed bandits – lost cash in ’em, stupidly",SLOT MACHINES,"anagram of LOST CASH IN EM;
"
1606,"After surprising veto duke’s dejected, defeated in the House",VOTED DOWN,"A charade of anagram of VETO; D for ‘duke’ and DOWN for ‘dejected’, with ‘surprising’ as the anagrind.
"
1607,"Awareness, in a sense",INSIGHT,"A charade of IN and SIGHT
"
1608,Grey gear?,NEUTRAL,"A dd.
"
1609,Depend on the German rowing club,LEANDER,"A charade of LEAN and DER for one of the German words for ‘the’.  The LEANDER rowing club is one of the oldest in the world and is based near Henley-on-Thames.  If I was being hyper-picky, I’d say that ‘lean’ and ‘depend’ are only synonymous in the phrasal verbs ‘lean on’ and ‘depend on’.
"
1610,Watch cutter pitch,SEESAW,"A charade of SEE and SAW; ‘pitch’ is the definition.  I couldn’t make sense of the surface for ages, but I think Everyman’s asking you to imagine that you’re safely on the shore watching a cutter (boat) pitching in rough seas.
"
1611,Wild ape is a brownish colour,SEPIA,"An anagram to finish off.  anagram of APE IS;
"
1612,Caught swindler on staff,CROOK,"I lied.  There is a cricket reference.  A charade of C for ‘caught’ and ROOK.  ‘A greedy or grasping person’ (SOED).
"
1613,dn  Evil chief a topline criminal?  He could be,VILLAIN OF THE PIECE,"anagram of EVIL CHIEF A TOPLINE;  Here’s where you had to sort out that ‘criminal’ is an anagrind.  An &littish clue, and a good one.
"
1614,"Yes, reportedly they shoot terrorists",IRA,"The abbreviation for the Irish Republican Army is a homophone of AYE for ‘yes’, and RA for the Royal Artillery.
"
1615,English fit in somewhere in Surrey,EWELL,"A charade of E and WELL.  Might have seen this a few times before, but the setter’s reasoning will be that there’s naff all else that fits E?E?L, so we’ll forgive him.
"
1616,Jerk!’ said Liberal briefly to fan of Nick,DIABOLIST,"Don’t get me started about Clegg and tuition fees or we’ll be here till next Monday.  My son at university is incapable of saying the two words ‘Nick Clegg’ without putting in front what I think grammarians call ‘an intensifier’.  Anyway, it’s anagram of SAID LIB TO; with ‘jerk’ as the anagrind.
"
1617,Studied for a degree after employment,PERUSED,"A charade of PER (‘for a’) USE and D for ‘degree’.
"
1618,Maybe heartless and misguided,OFF,"-BEAM‘Not on the right track; mistaken’, says the SOED; so a dd.  I think.
"
1619,International record accepted as rubbish,INEPT,"An insertion of EP for ‘record’ in INT.  As in ‘I am so rubbish at spotting ninas’.
"
1620,Criminals (not us) steal without resistance,THE MOB,"A charade of THEM (who are not us) and [R]OB.
"
1621,Lots of laws passed – occasionally some rejected,CODES,"Hidden reversed in pasSED OCcasionally.
"
1622,Welcome competition with European doctor,EMBRACE,"The definition is ‘welcome’ and it’s a charade of E, MB for ‘doctor’ and RACE, but I’m not convinced the clue unequivocally tells you to put the EMB before the RACE.
"
1623,Amusements here not just provided by female,FUNFAIR,"A charade of F and UNFAIR.
"
1624,Craftsman’s role doing repairs,GONDOLIER,"anagram of ROLE DOING; with a pun on ‘craftsman’.
"
1625,Tania attacked her,ANITA,"anagram of TANIA;
"
1626,That man as indicated breaking law on return – odd,WHIMSICAL,"An insertion of HIM (‘that man’) and SIC (‘as indicated’, used – especially in newspapers – to indicate that there’s a misspelling in the original text that is reproduced) in LAW reversed.
"
1627,Talk of thieves taking money from girl,ARGOT,"[M]ARGOT
"
1628,Gang murder’s within one’s capabilities,SKILL SET,"An insertion of KILLS in SET.
"
1629,Didn’t meet party leaders – one’s upset,EVADED,"Can’t say Tyrus is not being politically correct here: we’ve had Nick, now we’ve got caring sharing Dave, and red Ed.  It’s a reversal (‘upset’) of DAVE and then ED.
"
1630,"Unaided, catches international criminal",AL CAPONE,"An insertion of CAP in ALONE for the Chicago gangster.  CAP in the sense of sporting cap: ‘He’s an England cap/he’s an England international’.
"
1631,Going to witter on about bribe,PAY OFF,"Well, the nearest I can get to explaining this is that ‘bribe’ is the definition; ‘going’ is OFF (‘I’m off/I’m going’) and PAY is a reversal of YAP for ‘witter’.  But how the clue tells me to put PAY before OFF I can’t see.  So help with the parsing of this one appreciated.
"
1632,Daring sideline fighting crime,INSIDER DEALING,"anagram of DARING SIDELINE; with ‘fighting’ as the anagrind.  There are some very clever anagrams in this puzzle.
"
1633,Way to identify criminal in suit (not British),E,"-FIT[B]EFIT for the modern way of producing a mugshot of a suspected criminal.  Used to be called PHOTO-FIT, I fancy.
"
1634,Activist – one spied round street by St Paul’s,CHEAPSIDE,"The street behind St Paul’s Cathedral anagram of where the Underground station is) is a charade of CHE (Guevara), A, and (SPIED; with ’round’ as the anagrind.
"
1635,Inhuman robber baron demanded endless kinky sex,ONE,"-ARMED BANDITPlease … it’s Monday breakfast and this will have those *i* solvers converted from the Telegraph crossword spluttering into their coffee and writing further letters to the editor.  It’s anagram of BARON DEMANDE[D]; plus IT for ‘sex’ with ‘kinky’ as the anagrind.  I’m not head over heels in love with ‘inhuman robber’ as the definition, but the enumeration is a big help, and the surface made me smile.
"
1636,Crimes solved by one-time criminal,MISCREANT,"Great surface.  ‘Criminal’ here is the definition: Tyrus is asking you to make an anagram anagram of ‘solved’) of (CRIMES; and then add AN for ‘one’ and T for ‘time’.
"
1637,Mineral on counter offender picked up,CINNABAR,"The mercuric ore is a homophone – ‘picked up’ – of ‘sinner’ for ‘offender’ on BAR for ‘counter’.
"
1638,Drinking party not about to wake up,AROUSE,"[C]AROUSE
"
1639,Criminal gang emptied lorry fast,FIRMLY,"A charade of FIRM and LY for LorrY ’emptied’ of its middle three letters.
"
1640,Got bigger?  Take out dress,GOWN,"Deviously clued, I thought, and it took me a while to see.  It’s G[R]OWN, and the ‘take out’ instruction is inviting you to remove R for ‘recipe’, the Latin imperative for ‘take’, used (at least in days gone by) on prescriptions.
"
1641,Bent officer is arresting Unionist,GENIUS,"A charade of GEN for General or ‘Officer’ and an insertion of U for ‘Unionist’ in IS.  Maybe dictionaries will prove me wrong, but for me, ‘bent’ and ‘genius’ aren’t really synonymous.  If I say ‘I have a bent for cricket’ it doesn’t mean that I’m brilliant at it.
"
1642,Friend’s confronting baddies regularly – and paling,PALISADE,"A charade of PAL IS for ‘friend’s’ and ADE for the even letters of bAdDiEs.  The definition and the answer are pretty close, though, aren’t they?
"
1643,No sailors either from Northumberland?,NORTHERN,"I wanted to put in this answer once I’d got a couple of crossing letters, but couldn’t see how the clue worked.  But it’s cleverly done: NOR THE RN is a way of saying ‘no sailors either’ and The Farne Islands are one of the hundred places you should visit before you die.
"
1644,It’s heavenly playing harp on the banks of the Seine,SERAPH,"Once I’d convinced myself that PHRASE wasn’t anything to do with heaven, this one made sense.  anagram of HARP; after SE for the outside letters of ‘SeinE’.  And one of the very few words in English that makes its plural by adding -IM.
"
1645,Cello and cornet I played for Remembrance,RECOLLECTION,"anagram of CELLO CORNET I; with ‘played’ as the anagrind.
"
1646,Spike Milligan’s last bow’s enthralling,TINE,"The sticky-out thing on the end of your fork is an insertion of N for the last letter of MilligaN included (‘enthralling’) in TIE for ‘bow’.
"
1647,"Setter’s a hoot, we hear – that’s sweet",ICE CREAM,"A homophone of I SCREAM.
"
1648,Brilliant system of measurement captures extremes of El Niño,METEORIC,"An insertion of EO for the outside letters of El NiñO in METRIC.  Again, I wasn’t convinced that ‘brilliant’ and METEORIC were the same thing.
"
1649,Sect exposed in actuality oddly dissolving,CULT,"Hidden in aCtUaLiTy.  Perhaps not the greatest surface that Glow-worm has ever produced, unless I’m missing something.
"
1650,Where fighter comes in to disrobe on stairhead?,LANDING STRIP,"If you’re into taking your kit off in front of your neighbours, you’ll get this one.  It’s a cd, and a clue I especially liked.
"
1651,Otiose and deceitful – take a month off and regroup,FUTILE,"The setter is asking you to take DEC, the month, out of anagram of [DEC]EITFUL;  And ‘regroup’ is the anagrind.
"
1652,Pernicious Cadillac I’m in is deficient in reverse,INIMICAL,"Hidden reversed in CadiLAC IM IN Is.  The surface again isn’t great – how can a Cadillac be pernicious?
"
1653,Get rid of reported mole on lad’s side,JETTISON,"A definition of ‘mole’ that I’d never come across.  ‘A massive structure, esp of stone, serving as a pier’  (SOED).  So it’s a charade of a homophone of ‘jetty’ and SON for ‘lad’.
"
1654,Crib graduate’s new limitless source of ideas,MANGER,"‘Away in a manger; no crib for a bed.’  A charade of MA for ‘graduate’, N for ‘new’ and GER for GER[M] as in ‘a germ of an idea’.
"
1655,Deity wound up,EROS,"A reversal of SORE.
"
1656,Step in time with Eve ‘n’ Erin’s dancing,INTERVENE,"The definition is ‘step in’.  It’s anagram of T EVE N ERIN;
"
1657,Beg to live away – adopting Portugal as address,SPEECH,"[BE]SEECH with an insertion of P for ‘Portugal’.
"
1658,US indie company plans special version of Brains Trust …,PANEL DISCUSSION,"anagram of US INDIE CO PLANS;
"
1659,might he enjoy it once weekly?,LISTENER,"For once the ellipses mean something … Glow-worm is suggesting that a fan of *Brains Trust* might listen to it once a week.
"
1660,Rod Peacock?,STRUT,"I didn’t much like this.  It’s a dd: the first half works clearly, but to describe a peacock as a ‘strut’ is a step too far, isn’t it?  Peacocks do strut, but that’s not to say that they are struts.  Happen I’m missing something.
"
1661,Lecturer visiting island tied up?  Shocking!,DEPLORABLE,"A reversal (up in a down clue) of ELBA and ROPED with L for ‘lecturer’ inserted.
"
1662,Shining age with true possibilities for fliers,LITERATURE,"A charade of LIT for ‘shining’, ERA for ‘age’ and anagram of TRUE; with ‘possibilities’ as the anagrind.  ‘Fliers’ for LITERATURE works, but they are pretty loose synonyms, in my opinion.
"
1663,"Pen erotic composition, do!",RECEPTION,"anagram of PEN EROTIC;
"
1664,VIP is present in heart of procession,PRINCESS,"Didn’t like this one at all.  VIP for PRINCESS?  Not in my opinion, but that’s by the by.  Why not PRINCE, or QUEEN, or KING?  It just seems a bit of a random definition.  It’s PR for ‘present’ (although it’s in none of my dictionaries), IN and CESS for the middle letters of proCESSion.
"
1665,"Bromide, after initially tasting, is swallowed in liquor",TRUISM,"I always appreciate learning something from a crossword, and this was a new one for me.  ‘A soothing platitude or trite remark’ (SOED).  And I always thought it was something that was put in soldiers’ tea.  T for the first letter of ‘tasting’, followed by IS in RUM.
"
1666,Implication of Penny’s separation …,DRIFT,"D for ‘denarius’ as in LSD, pounds, shillings and pence; then RIFT for ‘separation’.  Do you get my drift?
"
1667,was initially maturity of income,WAGE,"A charade of W for the first letter of Was and AGE for ‘maturity’.  The clue is fine, but as we age, do we mature?  Discuss.
"
1668,Piece of hip hop’s broadcast round backyard,RHAPSODY,"If you can’t explain a clue, it might as well be 1 across.  All I can come up with is that it’s anagram of HOPS YARD; and ‘piece’ looks like the definition while ‘broadcast’ looks like the anagrind, but somebody else is going to have to tell me how this works.
"
1669,Thief taking dresser without key?,ROBBER,"Once you’d got some crossing letters, it couldn’t be much else, but it took me a while to see this.  It’s ROBER for ‘dresser’ outside (‘without’) B for the musical key.
"
1670,One son’s in slight hint of trouble,NUISANCE,"An insertion (‘in’) of IS in NUANCE for ‘slight hint’.
"
1671,Derrick’s putting grease on machinery,OIL RIG,"A charade of OIL for ‘grease’ and RIG for ‘machinery’.
"
1672,Cut short heavy old slow movement,LARGO,"The musical term for a ‘slow movement’ is LARG[E] plus O for ‘old’.  ‘Heavy’ for ‘large’?
"
1673,Brains and a pretty head?,ACUTENESS,"‘Brains’ for ACUTENESS?  Maybe not in a Quiptic, methinks.  It’s a charade of A, CUTE and NESS for an archaic word for promontory or ‘head’
"
1674,Innate tendency to censure and abuse,SECOND NATURE,"anagram of TO CENSURE AND;  The anagrind is ‘abuse’.
"
1675,Unseasonal warmth brings forth sub-continental adder,INDIAN SUMMER,"A phrase meaning hot weather in late summer is a charade of INDIAN for ‘sub-continental’ and SUMMER for ‘adder’.
"
1676,Cousin Rex organised trip,EXCURSION,"anagram of COUSIN REX;
"
1677,My turn to cut the herb for cooking,THYME,"Hectence is asking you to reverse (‘turn’) MY and then put it in THE to give you the culinary herb.
"
1678,Reach out to former nurse,EXTEND,"A charade of EX for ‘former’ and TEND for ‘nurse’, but I’m not sure what ‘to’ is doing for the cryptic grammar.
"
1679,Holy man’s not returned from ramble,RABBIT ON,"A nice surface and clue.  Another charade: of RABBI for ‘holy man’ and TON for a reversal (‘returned’) of NOT.
"
1680,"Dad’s lost bearings, being upset",SADDEN,"A charade of anagram of DADS; and EN for ‘bearings’, East and North.  ‘Lost’ is the anagrind.
"
1681,Respected heads of European states reportedly co-operated,ESTEEMED,"A charade of ES for the first letters of ‘European states’ plus a homophone of ‘teamed’.  I’m not enamoured of ‘teamed’ for ‘co-operated’.  We ‘teamed up’ means ‘we co-operated’ but you can’t ‘co-operate up’.
"
1682,Bug scuttled over large beast,RANKLE,"The clue works fine, and perhaps it’s just me, but this is a tricky clue for a puzzle designed for new cryptic fans.  RANKLE and ‘bug’ are synonyms; then it’s RAN for ‘scuttled’ with KLE for a reversal (‘over’) of ELK, which is indeed one of many ‘large beasts’.
"
1683,Secondary navigation by way of train lines gets birds home,AVIARY,"If I’ve understood this well, then it’s A for the second letter of nAvigation, followed by VIA for ‘by way of’ and RY for railway or ‘train lines’.  Expecting a beginner to twig that ‘secondary navigation’ means A is a bit of an ask, I think.
"
1684,TV show: very much a quiet time after work,SOAP OPERA,"Something like EastEnders is a charade of SO for ‘very much’, A, P for musically ‘quiet’, and ERA for ‘time’ after OP for ‘work’, the abbreviation for ‘opus’.
"
1685,Police rise high in patriots cruel tyranny,DICTATORSHIP,"A charade of DIC for CID anagram of ‘police’) reversed and (IN PATRIOTS;  ‘High’ is the anagrind.
"
1686,Give thoughts on pie ingredients,OPINE,"anagram of ON PIE; ‘Ingredients’ is the – not brilliant in my opinion – anagrind.
"
1687,Bear cub disrupted English party cooking food outdoors,BARBECUE,"anagram of BEAR CUB; and E for ‘English’ with ‘disrupted’ as the anagrind.
"
1688,Record disheartened Rorke’s Drift soldiers coming back up,REGISTER,
1689,Lady pursuing good times has strange slant on principles,FUNDAMENTALS,"A charade of FUN for ‘good times’, DAME for ‘lady’ and anagram of SLANT;  with ‘strange’ as the anagrind.
"
1690,Prisoner jumping from a soft-top car can be stopped,AVERTIBLE,"A ‘prisoner’ is a ‘con’ and if you take that out of A [CON]VERTIBLE, you’ll get a rather obscure word that means ‘can be stopped’.
"
1691,Determined Hebridean island’s to harbour longship,TIRELESS,"This is a clever clue, so I’m sorry to be critical, but I think it’s way too hard for a Quiptic.  The definition is ‘determined’.  Then you have to put L for ‘long’ in TIREE for the island featured every day in the shipping forecast, and add SS for ‘ship’ at the end.  You have to ‘lift and separate’ ‘longship’, and ‘harbour’ is the insertion indicator.
"
1692,Cultured university guy’s besieged by journalists,EDUCATED,"An insertion (‘besieged’) of U for ‘university’ and CAT for ‘guy’ in two ‘journalists’ (ED and ED).  ‘He’s a cool cat.’
"
1693,Scheme to get unknowns into rising NY team,SYSTEM,"Because it’s a down clue, Hectence is telling you to put YS for ‘unknowns’ into the New York METS.  ‘Y’ is one of the mathematically unknown letters X, Y or Z, and its plural is Ys.
"
1694,Drink to Queen’s name in Hull,PERNOD,"An insertion of ER for *Elizabeth Regina*, our current Queen and N for ‘name’ in POD for ‘hull’ in its verbal sense.  But again, what’s the ‘to’ doing in the surface?
"
1695,Wash out some swimwear in sea water,RINSE,"Hidden in swimeaR IN SEa water.
"
1696,Bishop managed church division within large organisation,BRANCH,"A clearly signposted charade to give us some starting letters for the down clues. B for ‘bishop’, RAN for ‘managed’ and CH for ‘church’.
"
1697,Somehow I stop before edge of precipice catching two females on dangerous slope?,OFF,"-PISTEAn insertion anagram of ‘catching’) of FF for ‘two females’ in (I STOP; plus E for the last letter (‘edge’) of precipicE.  ‘Somehow’ is the anagrind.
"
1698,Gather what mathematician may do to make approximation,ROUND UP,"A dd.
"
1699,Polish image that signifies a famous boundary,RUBICON,"A charade of RUB for ‘polish’ and ICON for ‘image’.  I have the impression that ICONIC has shifted its meaning in the last ten years or so.  Strictly it’s to do with religious imagery, but even David Beckham is iconic these days.
"
1700,Hard worker in church given employment as singer,CHANTEUSE,"An insertion (‘in’) of H and ANT for ‘hard’ and ‘worker’ in C for ‘church’ and USE for ’employment’.  Une CHANTEUSE is a female singer, and we’ve nicked the word from our opponents in Donetsk later on today.  Let’s hope we can nick a result.
"
1701,Birds in castles,ROOKS,"A dd, with the chess piece as the second.
"
1702,"Supports eminence, the fellow lacking the ability to see ahead",SECOND SIGHT,"I think this is a charade of SECONDS for ‘supports’ and [M]IGHT for the removal of man for ‘fellow’ from MIGHT for ’eminence’, but am happy to be corrected.
"
1703,Old character going around with some of the stars,DRACO,"Not Mr Malfoy this time, but the constellation.  I did need the list of stars and constellations in my dog-eared Thesaurus to get this one.  It’s a reversal (‘going round’) of O for ‘old’ and CARD for ‘character’.  ‘Oooh, he’s a real card.’
"
1704,Left-winger trapping various Tories celebrated noisily,ROISTERED,"An insertion anagram of ‘trapping’) of (TORIES; in RED for ‘left-winger’.  ‘Various’ is the anagrind.
"
1705,Great joy when beer comes round (nothing in can),ELATION,"A charade of ELA for a reversal of ALE and an insertion of O (‘nothing’) in TIN for ‘can’.
"
1706,Almost reluctant to stop?,GOING ON,"I’m guessing that this is a cd, but I can’t really explain it.  Over to you …
"
1707,Agent’s outside hostelry with drug where bushes may provide cover,SPINNEYS,"An insertion of INN and E for ‘ecstasy’ in SPYS for ‘agent’s’.  If setters took E as often as they used it to clue ‘drug’ they’d be so spaced out that the cruciverbal world would grind to a halt.  According to one source, ‘Ecstasy (E) can lead to emotional openness, euphoria, an intense, energetic, spiritual high; and can connect people freely and openly with each other, promote deep inner thinking and analysis, or lead to a reduction in cynical or critical thoughts’.  Solving cryptic crosswords leads to the same thing, imho.  And it’s a lot less dangerous, of course.
"
1708,Singers beginning to chant in front of Egyptian god,CHORUS,"Another word for ‘choir’ or ‘singers’ is a charade of C for the first letter of ‘chant’ and HORUS, the Egyptian god of the sky.
"
1709,Polly’s home perhaps in Cambridge – sadly lacking room for male,BIRDCAGE,"‘E’s joined the bleedin’ choir invisible.  This is an EX-PARROT!’  Quixote’s asking you to remove the M for ‘male’ from ‘Cambridge’ and then make an anagram: anagram of CA[M]BRIDGE;  ‘Sadly’ is the anagrind.
"
1710,Mature editor penning article will be given excessive praise perhaps,ADULATED,"An insertion (‘penning’) of A in ADULT ED.  Not sure why the ‘perhaps’ is there, since ‘given excessive praise’ is a perfectly good definition of ADULATED.
"
1711,Trainee is bad sort – and not English!,CADET,"A charade of CAD for ‘bad sort’ and ET for the Latin (ie not English) word for ‘and’.  Or indeed French.
"
1712,Troubled airman finally cradled in fog making his manoeuvre to counteract weather?,FORCED LANDING,"It’s anagram of N CRADLED IN; inserted into FOG, but isn’t ‘in’ doing double duty here?  I’ve never quite understood what the ‘rules’ are about this.
"
1713,Turning up to join hundred in fights – boozy events,PUB CRAWLS,"A reversal of UP followed by an insertion of C for ‘hundred’ in BRAWLS for ‘fights’.
"
1714,District has second religious minister having got rid of the first,SECTOR,"A charade of S and [R]ECTOR.
"
1715,Man lodging in northern estate,ERNEST,"Hidden in northERN ESTate.
"
1716,Singer establishing cult may prance around,PAUL MCCARTNEY,"anagram of CULT MAY PRANCE;
"
1717,The man’s man full of perverse rubbish?  One sort of academic,HISTORIAN,"A charade of HIS for ‘the man’s’ and IAN for ‘man’ with an insertion (‘full of’) TOR, which is ROT (‘rubbish’) reversed (‘perverse’).
"
1718,A sort of fish repeatedly put into gelatinous substance,AGAR,"-AGARA GAR repeated gives you the vegetarian alternative to gelatine, used in cooking.
"
1719,Trainee medics possibly taking bosses round one part of the hospital,STUDENTS,"‘Trainee medics possibly’ is the definition and it’s an insertion of ENT for ‘Ear, Nose and Throat’ in STUDS for ‘bosses’.  ‘Trainees’ would have worked just as well, but the medics bit is there to give a better story-telling surface.  Otorhinolaryngology is the posh name for ENT, but personally I’ll be sticking with the acryonym.
"
1720,Poisonous types more miserable first to last,ADDERS,"Quixote’s inviting you to make the first letter of SADDER become the last.  ADDER is an interesting word: in Old English, *næddre* meant any snake, not just an adder; in Middle English people called the snake A NADDER (and apparently some Northern dialects have maintained this usage); then by a process the name of which I’ve forgotten, the N got stuck onto the indefinite article and it became AN ADDER.  But in French today, the slippery fellow is still *un nadre*.
"
1721,Herb used to be a person without sexual preference?,WASABI,"I’m sure this has been done before, but it still made me smile. If I used to fancy both boys and girls (and I firmly refute any allegations to that effect) then I WAS A BI.  WASABI is used in Japanese cuisine.  A quick butcher’s online suggests that it’s a root rather than a herb, but I’m no botanist.
"
1722,End of skirt well up to reveal this?,THIGH,"A charade of T for the last letter of skirT and HIGH for ‘well up’.
"
1723,"Female impersonators, when retired, can cut long hair",ACTRESSES,"A reversal of CA[N] and TRESSES.
"
1724,Send son with it (as named or suggested here),SHIP,"The theme requires you to think of SHIP in its nounal sense; but it’s clued here as a verb.  S for ‘son’ followed by HIP for ‘with it’.  The bracketed part of the clue is hinting at a hidden theme of SHIPS, with two spelled out (‘named’) and the third ‘suggested’ because NINA is the term for a hidden message.  How many Average Joe solvers who aren’t Fifteensquared aficionados know that is another question, so I fancy there might be some confused folk out there in the real world this week.  And of course Columbus’ ship was the *Niña*, which would be pronounced differently from the little girl’s name; but punctuation and diacritics are ignored in cryptics, so the clue works absolutely fine.
"
1725,Team annoyed a little about computer storage information,METADATA,"A charade of anagram of TEAM; plus a reversal of A TAD.  ‘Annoyed’ is the anagrind.
"
1726,Members of council unnaturally retiring around these parts,ANNULI,"The plural of ANNULUS for ‘a ring-shaped part’ is hidden reversed in councIL UNNAturally.
"
1727,Somebody helping young woman to come out of her shell,AIDE,"I wanted to put in AIDE as soon as I’d got the crossing letters, but couldn’t see it for ages.  It’s [M]AIDE[N], with ‘come out of her shell’ as the clever removal indicator.
"
1728,What trader may say is highly desirable,IDEAL,"A homophone of I DEAL, which is indeed what a trader may say.
"
1729,Said to regret loss of PM?  No,MORN,"Another homophone (‘said’) of ‘mourn’, and if it’s not PM it must be AM, or MORN.
"
1730,Extends across lake away from trees,ARCHES,"[L]ARCHES
"
1731,Can I do rewrite of verse for Pretty Boy?,ADONIC,"anagram of CAN I DO; gives you the adjective relating to ADONIS, who was allegedly a very pretty boy.
"
1732,"End of story, you hear!",TAIL,"A further homophone, of ‘tale’.
"
1733,Passage of 16’s third 7,LARGO,"A slow passage in music is a charade of L for the third letter of CoLumbus and ARGO, which was Jason’s ship.
"
1734,Thirty days for family in Ireland extended,SEPT,"No, I hadn’t either, but it’s in the dictionary: ‘a branch of a tribe or nation, esp in medieval Ireland or Scotland’.
"
1735,"Cardinal, one in touch with his feminine side?",NEWMAN,"Referring to Cardinal John Henry NEWMAN, DD CO (1801-1890), who despite living most of his life with another man and asking to be buried next to him, wasn’t gay.  Well, the Holy See says so, so it must be true.  ‘NEW MAN: a type of modern man who allows the caring side of his nature to show by being supportive and by sharing child care and housework.’  I thought we were all like that.
"
1736,Choose tenor before getting involved with a show such as this,OPERETTA,"An insertion (‘getting involved’) of ERE for ‘before’ in OPT and T for ‘tenor’ followed by A.
"
1737,"Japanese originals, gold, around home",AINU,"When in doubt, follow the instructions.  ‘A member of the aboriginal people of Japan.’  An insertion of IN for ‘home’ in AU for the chemical symbol for gold.
"
1738,"Emmental, ham and a drop of Rioja in hamper",ENTRAMMEL,"A new one on me, but once I’d twigged that ‘ham’ was the anagrind, then it was a question of getting a few crossing letters.  anagram of EMMENTAL R;
"
1739,Josh under attack initially unworried,AT EASE,"Since it’s a down clue, Tyrus is asking you to put TEASE for ‘josh’ under A, the first letter of ‘attack’.
"
1740,"Dad, maybe, about to raise crucial point",RELATIVE,"Your Dad certainly is a relative, and to get there you need to make a charade of RE for ‘about’, LATIV for a reversal of VITAL, ‘crucial’ and E for East, a ‘point’ of the compass.
"
1741,is genuine – heart’s uplifted,ISRAEL,"The State of ISRAEL ‘is genuine’ or IS REAL with the middle two letters (‘heart’) of the second element exchanged, or ‘uplifted’.
"
1742,Are boy and celebrity going up together?,AS ONE MAN,"A charade of A SON and a reversal of NAME for ‘celebrity’.
"
1743,Old woman raised girl in country,AMERICA,"A reversal of MA for ‘old woman’ and ERICA.
"
1744,Declare wealth to be as 16 in in 5d,STATE CAPITAL,"STATE for ‘declare’ followed by CAPITAL for ‘wealth’ gives you Columbus, the state capital of Ohio.
"
1745,One walking furtively avoids sun lounger,IDLER,"[S]IDLER.
"
1746,"Not good to begin with, lady singer’s range",AGA,"The yummy mummy’s cooker of choice is a removal of the first letter, G, from (Lady) [G]AGA.  For the elderly and infirm, she’s a pop singer.
"
1747,Post nearly given to black 5D film director,COLUMBUS,"A charade of COLUM[N], B for ‘black’ and US for 5dn or ‘America’.  It’s referring to Chris COLUMBUS, the film director who was involved in the *Harry Potter* series.
"
1748,s on this spot when caught,SEA,"Ships are at SEA.  It’s a homophone of ‘see’ for ‘spot’ with ‘caught’ as the homophone indicator: ‘I didn’t quite catch what you said.’
"
1749,See leader once said to be unreliable,DIOCESAN,"anagram of ONCE SAID; with ‘to be unreliable’ as the anagrind.
"
1750,Local guide has mounting passion for countryman,AZERI,"A resident of Azerbaijan is a charade of AZ (A to Z) for ‘local guide’ and a reversal (‘mounting’, since it’s a down clue) of IRE.
"
1751,"Being in a relationship, enjoyed grabbing a bit of nookie",LINKED,"It’s the Sabbath Day, and such impure thoughts should be banished from our minds.  It’s N for ‘a bit of nookie’ in LIKED.
"
1752,Finally go and sort out somewhere to sleep,ROOST,"anagram of O SORT; with ‘out’ as the anagrind.
"
1753,Jane’s novel way to start family tree,STEMMA,"Again, when in doubt follow the instructions: put ST for ‘street’ or ‘way’ in front of Ms Austen’s novel EMMA.  ‘A family tree, pedigree’, says Collins.
"
1754,"Timewise, breakfast and brunch are for 34",BOTHAM,"Our first 34.  Sir Ian, most famous for his heroics in beating the Aussies against all odds at Headingley in 1981, and now an opinionated but entertaining commentator.  Since breakfast and brunch are morning meals, they are BOTH AM.
"
1755,scorer,STRAUSS,"And our second.  Andrew STRAUSS is currently England’s test captain, an intelligent, modest and articulate leader of the team.  I know less about classical music than I do about cricket, but there are at least a couple of composers called STRAUSS that have ‘scored’ music, although to my knowledge neither of them opened the batting.
"
1756,Back regular characters among several touring Tolkien’s realm to find home of metal birds?,AERODROME,"Possibly not Punk’s most elegant clue ever.  ‘Metal birds’ are planes, whose home is an AERODROME, which is a reversal (‘back’) of EEA, the even letters of ‘sEvErAl’ with an insertion of MORDOR, one of the kingdoms in J R R Tolkien’s *Lord of the Rings*.
"
1757,s elegance,GRACE,"Referring to William Gilbert GRACE, the famous (or infamous, depending on your opinion) cricketer from the late 19th and early 20th century.  ‘They came to see me bat, not you bowl’, he is alleged to have said after being bowled for a golden duck, replacing the bails, and taking guard again.
"
1758,Runner almost getting 0,NIL,"NIL[E]  ‘Runner’ as in ‘river’, rather than the batsman who comes in to do the running for a team-mate who has sustained an injury during his innings.
"
1759,"Large sum of money, perfect",MINT,"A dd.  ‘She’s earning a mint at the moment.’  ‘That is mint.’
"
1760,Sex god beginning to tan in the south of France,STUD,"An insertion of T for the first letter of ‘tan’ in SUD for the French word for ‘south’.  A STUD would be a ‘sex god’ only in his opinion, I guess.
"
1761,Score not made by 34 as lesser player,EXTRA,"Another dd.  If a run is scored and not credited to the batsman (34), then it’s an EXTRA, but counts towards the overall total.  The other definition is for a spear-carrier in a film.
"
1762,"Spinner spinning nine out, having restricted runs",NEUTRINO,"Another cricketing surface, although Jim Laker was one of the few to achieve that, at Old Trafford in 1956 anagram of he also got ten in the other innings).  (NINE OUT R; with ‘spinner’ as the definition and ‘spinning’ as the anagrind.  A NEUTRINO is a sub-atomic particle and has been much in the news recently because of the experiments at CERN.  Does it really spin?  Where’s a physicist when you need one?
"
1763,Divine wedding of Lucifer the fallen angel?,A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN,"A dd cum cd.  Lucifer is indeed the ‘fallen angel’, having started off in a high place and then fallen to a lower one.  And ‘Lucifer’ is also a word for a MATCH that you use to light the fire, for example.
"
1764,"Dresser cuts expletive, seeing 34",FLINTOFF,"This would be difficult to get if you didn’t know much about cricket, I fancy.  It’s LINT for ‘dresser’ in the surgical sense inside F OFF, which is certainly an expletive.  Andrew ‘Freddie’ FLINTOFF made his England debut in 1998 but will be most remembered for two things: his awesome performances in England’s successful 2005 Ashes series, and for trying to steer a pedalo when completely off his head.
"
1765,Floor blanket,THROW,"A dd, with the word being used in its verbal and nounal senses.
"
1766,"s domain, three balls perhaps before a half century",OVAL,"The OVAL is one of London’s two Test venues, so that’s the definition; I’m going to have a crack at parsing it as OV for half of an OVER, which is six balls and A L for A and the Roman numeral for ‘fifty’, which is a half century.
"
1767,Christian medico orbiting the moon,DIOR,"An insertion of IO for one of Jupiter’s moons (as well as a crossword setter) in DR for ‘medico’.  Why ‘medico’ and not just ‘medic’, I don’t know.  Christian DIOR.
"
1768,Some characters achieving turn,ACT,"Hidden in charACTers.
"
1769,Bid from umpire overturned,OFFER,"A charade of OF and a reversal of REF.
"
1770,"Point one may be at, where 5’4″ ruler applied to six footer",CRICKETER,"If I’m going to be critical, this gateway clue is pretty much essential to solving the puzzle, and it’s not exactly a gimme, since you have to have a knowledge of the game to have a chance to solve it.  Fair enough, ‘six footer’ is going to point you in the direction of an insect, but still …  A CRICKETER may indeed be ‘at point’, since that’s a fielding position square of the wicket on the off side.  CRICKET is of course one of a squillion insects.  And Brenda (sorry, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, or ER) could loosely be described as a ‘ruler’, depending on your point of view, but most certainly is 5’4″ tall.  Which is why Nicolas Sarkozy enjoyed his state visit so much a while ago.
"
1771,Most points bagged by 34 back for the team,ARSENAL,"If you don’t like sport, you won’t have liked this.  Arsene Wenger’s lot are an insertion of SEN for three points of the compass (‘most points’) in a reversal (‘back’) of LARA, for Brian Charles LARA, the legendary West Indian cricketer who still holds the record for the most runs scored in first-class cricket, 501 not out for Warwickshire against Durham in 1994.
"
1772,villain about right,BRADMAN,"Another cricketer: Punk’s asking you to put R for ‘right’ in BAD MAN to give you Don BRADMAN, who famously fell agonisingly short of averaging 100 in Tests when he was bowled for a duck in his last appearance in that form of the game, needing just four runs to make the landmark.  And of course another setter.  This is turning into a setters’ love-in, I think.
"
1773,Not entirely brown design natural for large arachnid,TARANTULA,"An easy clue to get you going if you didn’t twig the cricket theme.  TA[N] for ‘not entirely brown’ followed by anagram of NATURAL; with ‘design’ as the anagrind.
"
1774,"Bowling success taking out opener and tail, someone in assistance",AIDE,"Definitely a setters’ love-in, since Punk and Tyrus have clearly been sitting at the back of class and copying.  In my blog of Tyrus’ Sunday Indy puzzle yesterday, he had ‘Somebody helping young woman to come out of her shell’.  Punk’s take on it is along the same lines: [M]AIDE[N], but with the cricketing reference, since a MAIDEN would be a ‘bowling success’ because it’s an over a bowler delivers without conceding any runs.
"
1775,"In conclusion, score’s retained",TRENDY,"The definition is ‘in’. It’s an insertion (‘retained’) of END for ‘conclusion’ in TRY for a ‘score’ in rugby.
"
1776,View fish,ANGLE,"A dd.
"
1777,Rod’s fleece,SHAFT,"I spent some time mentally searching for a synonym of ‘fleece’ before reminding myself that this was a Punk puzzle.  A dd.
"
1778,Point out no good 34,PONTING,"Again, obvious to me once I’d got the gateway clue, but since it’s a proper noun, maybe tough for those who aren’t into cricket.  But that’s what crossing letters are for.  anagram of POINT; plus NG for ‘no good’ with ‘out’ as the anagrind.  Ricky PONTING: even as an England fan, I’ll acknowledge that the Australian captain is one of the greatest cricketers of his generation.  However, I do fondly remember the time when he got a bag on at Trent Bridge when he was run out by a substitute fielder.
"
1779,Angel cuts up pitch in the end,SERAPH,"A synonym for ‘angel’ is a reversal of PARES for ‘cuts up’ and H for the last letter of ‘pitch’.
"
1780,"Plane perhaps, every engine running true, starts up",TREE,"A reversal of EERT for the first letters of Every Engine Running True.
"
1781,"A state, but not a pit",MINE,"M[A]INE, referring to the American North-East Coast state.
"
1782,"John up in gossip, not half – that’s insufficient",TOO LITTLE,"Because it’s a down clue, it’s an insertion of LOO for ‘john’ reversed in TITTLE, which is half of TITTLE-TATTLE for ‘gossip’.
"
1783,Jump into well – or dive?,FLEAPIT,"An insertion of LEAP for ‘jump’ into FIT for ‘well’.
"
1784,Small building century as 34,HUTTON,"Referring to Sir Len HUTTON, the Yorkshire and England cricketer.  A charade of HUT for ‘small building’ and TON for ‘century’, and in my imagination at least referencing Gladstone Small, who played for England but never scored a century.
"
1785,Computer language where army post processed,FORTRAN,"A flashback.  The computer language of the 1970s is a charade of FORT for ‘where army post’ and RAN for ‘processed’.
"
1786,Opener skies pull before tea,WOTCHA,"Another nice cricketing surface.  Punk is nothing if not contemporary: WOTCHA is slang for ‘how are you doing?’ or in other words an opening gambit in conversation.  It’s a reversal (‘skies’, since it’s a down clue) of TOW for ‘pull’ and CHA for ‘tea’, which is the afternoon interval during a cricket match.  An abbreviation of ‘what cheer’: in the North-East, you’ll hear ‘What cheor, bonny lad?’
"
1787,Direct from the north or south,REFER,"‘Direct’ is the definition, and the clue works both ways (‘north or south’), since it’s a palindrome.
"
1788,spinner ultimately in decline,WARNE,"Well, I’m not going to call this &lit, because Warney will be on my case, but it’s an insertion of R for the last letter of spinneR in WANE for ‘decline’.  The Australian Shane WARNE was without doubt the best spinner of his era, and announced his arrival on the Ashes scene by pitching one a foot outside leg stump and clipping the top of off to bowl Mike Gatting, one of the best players of spin at the time, whose startled expression was pictured in the papers the next day.
"
1789,Iron Lady in retirement pursuing scaled down campaign for women’s rights,FEMINISM,"An insertion of MINI for ‘scaled down’ in FE for ‘iron’ and a reversal (‘in retirement’) of MS for ‘lady’.  Not sure that ‘pursuing’ is a suitable containment indicator, but happen I’m missing something.  ‘Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher’ was of course the Iron Lady.
"
1790,Gently persuaded female student to accept a kiss,COAXED,"Another insertion (‘to accept’) of A X in CO-ED.
"
1791,Doctor heartlessly unprescribing medicine,DRUG,"A charade of DR for ‘doctor’ and UG for the outside letters (‘heartlessly’) of UnprescribinG.
"
1792,Excesses of posh girl stirring up a hue and cry,DEBAUCHERY,"A charade of DEB, debutante, or ‘posh girl’ and anagram of A HUE CRY; with ‘stirring up’ as the anagrind.  DRUGS and DEBAUCHERY in two consecutive clues?  What was going on in Spider Towers when Arachne was putting this one together?
"
1793,Fruit which could give person energy,MANGO,"A charade of MAN and GO.  Unlike this setter to clue ‘person’ as MAN.
"
1794,King’s boring tendency to show knowledge,LEARNING,"An insertion (‘boring’) of R for ‘king’ or ‘Rex’ in LEANING for ‘tendency’.
"
1795,Reportedly deal with composer,HANDEL,"A homophone of ‘handle’.
"
1796,Queer Street for me,SETTER,"Well, let’s hope not.  Arachne is indeed a SETTER: anagram of STREET; with ‘queer’ as the anagrind.
"
1797,Watched terribly verbose daughter,OBSERVED,"anagram of VERBOSE; plus D for ‘daughter’ with ‘terribly’ as the anagrind.
"
1798,It’s found in forge in Indian village,ANVIL,"Hidden in IndiAN VILlage.
"
1799,Stew of scarce tuna and lobster?,CRUSTACEAN,"Sounds tasty.  anagram of SCARCE TUNA; with ‘stew’ as the anagrind.
"
1800,Children heading away from slides,KIDS,"[S]KIDS
"
1801,About to pursue sale of goods to the consumer,RETAIL,"A charade of RE for ‘about’ and TAIL for ‘pursue’.
"
1802,Couple get grant to make piece of jewellery,BRACELET,"A charade of BRACE for ‘couple’ and LET for ‘grant’.
"
1803,A church covered with faux antique carpet,REPROACH,"REPRO for ‘faux antique’ is covering A CH for ‘a church’, and it’s ‘carpet’ in its verbal sense.
"
1804,Time to leave pop star to warble,SING,"S[T]ING, referencing Mr Sumner, singer-songwriter, son of the North and now environmental champion.
"
1805,Chicken suffering from flatulence,WINDY,"A dd.  Not a pleasant image, although the suggested emission would no doubt have a hint of rotten eggs …
"
1806,Precise answer to conservative clergyman,ACCURATE,"A charade of A for ‘answer’, C for ‘conservative’ and CURATE for ‘clergyman’.
"
1807,Saw nothing wrong in US state,WASHINGTON,"anagram of SAW NOTHING;
"
1808,Cell in which you are in element,NEURON,"I didn’t get this STR8 away.  RUOK with clues like this?  Text-speak … naughty, naughty.  The retired colonels in Bexhill-on-Sea will be foaming at the mouth at such new-fangled devices.  UR in NEON.
"
1809,Cell for American of no fixed address,MOBILE,"A dd.  Americans call mobile phones cell phones.
"
1810,Sandy has to take the biscuit!,GINGERSNAP,"A charade of GINGER and SNAP.  If I may have a niggle, as a ginger-haired person myself (although with a generous amount of grey these days) I wouldn’t describe someone with ‘sandy’ hair as GINGER.
"
1811,Brief demise by way of bullet oddly to be desired,ENVIABLE,"A charade of EN[D] for ‘brief demise’, VIA and the odd letters of BuLlEt.
"
1812,"Rudolf, for example, lifting thinner partner in embrace",REINDEER,"Well, once you’ve got R for the first letter, it can’t be much else, so fair enough.  But I found it tricky to parse: it’s an insertion of N for a ‘partner’ in bridge in REEDIER for ‘thinner’, with ‘lifting’ as the reversal indicator in a down clue.
"
1813,"Five bared bust shamelessly, perhaps",ADVERB,"anagram of V BARED; with ‘bust’ as the anagrind.  ‘Shamelessly’ is an example of an ADVERB.  Makes me think Enid Blyton should have included this in her *Famous Five* series, although Timmy the dog might have been alarmed.
"
1814,Pub employees exclude males,BARMEN,"A charade of BAR and MEN.
"
1815,Imprisoned old Peruvian,INCAN,"A dd.  If you are IN CAN, you are ‘imprisoned’.
"
1816,Quick look round part of castle,KEEP,"Brilliant surface.  It’s a reversal (’round’) of PEEK, which is a ‘quick look’.
"
1817,Programme information collected by a US prosecutor,AGENDA,"An insertion of GEN for ‘information’ in A DA (District Attorney).
"
1818,British editor criticises hospital utensils,BEDPANS,"A charade of B, ED and PANS.
"
1819,Abandoned ship then devoured by monster,THE SPHINX,"Took me a good while to see this one.  It’s an insertion anagram of ‘devoured’) of (SHIP; in THEN, followed by X for ‘by’, as in ‘a piece of four by two’, or 4×2.  THE SPHINX is a mythical monster: if you couldn’t answer her riddle, she’d eat you.  Which is bad manners, really.
"
1820,Salesman receiving a cut,REAP,"An insertion of A in REP.
"
1821,"Saw, on reflection, nothing untoward in capital",WASHINGTON,"Nice surface reading.  A reversal of SAW followed by anagram of NOTHING;  ‘Untoward’ is the anagrind.

"
1823,Hold a medal intricately inscribed with name of statesman,NELSON MANDELA,"A charade of NELSON, for the wrestling hold, and an insertion of N in anagram of A MEDAL; with ‘intricately’ as the anagrind.  He’s looking increasingly frail these days.

"
1827,Band of Hope member ordered teas in bar,ABSTAINER,"It didn’t help that I was ignorant of what a ‘Band of Hope’ was, but it’s a clearly signposted anagram anagram of ‘ordered’) of (TEAS IN BAR;.  It’s a temperance organisation founded in Leeds in 1847, which makes the surface clever.  One to tuck away for future use.
"
1828,"Goddess, apparently sexless, heading off to gym",EUTERPE,"I was pleased to get this from the wordplay and check afterwards, although I had vaguely heard of it.  It’s [N]EUTER followed by PE.  Some people don’t like PE for ‘gym’, but it works for me.  EUTERPE is one of the Greek muses, less popular with setters than ERATO.
"
1829,"Flat, retreat for English poet",DRYDEN,"A charade of DRY for ‘flat’ in its ‘boring’ sense and DEN gives you the seventeenth century English poet and dramatist.
"
1830,"Very close friend to make changes to, say, opening of operetta",ALTER EGO,"The Latin phrase for your ‘other self’ – which by definition is a close friend, I suppose – is a charade of ALTER, EG for ‘say’ and O for the first letter of ‘operetta’

1831,Refined English stage worker,ELEGANT,"A charade of E, LEG and ANT.
"
1832,Information for fool with illegal drugs,DOPE,"A triple definition.
"
1833,"In exams, both cops failed to name every point in order",BOX THE COMPASS,"Everyman has a quirky habit of cluing some really obscure phrases.  I’d never heard of this.  To be fair to him, it’s clearly an anagram: anagram of EXAMS BOTH COPS; with ‘failed’ as the anagrind, and if you had the X from THE SPHINX and guessed THE for the second word, it couldn’t be much else.  ‘To name all 32 points of the compass in order’, although why you’d want to do that seems a reasonable question.
"
1834,"Extremely disreputable, Quinn let off, guilty of a minor offence",DELINQUENT,"A charade of DE for the first and last letters of DisreputablE and anagram of QUINN LET;  ‘Off’ is the anagrind.

1843,"Favourite tune, not bad",FAIR,"A charade of F for ‘favourite’ and AIR for ‘tune’.  Not sure I’ve come across this abbreviation for F before, and it’s not in my dictionaries; but I’m guessing
"
1844,"Idiot – he is quiet, say, as one stuck on the line?",CLOTHES PEG,"A multi-part charade of CLOT for ‘idiot’, HE’S for ‘he is’, P for musically ‘quiet’ and EG for ‘say’.
"
1845,Rake caught by rules and regulations,CLAW,"A charade of C and LAW.
"
1846,Buddy in ship coming to Spanish waters?,MAIN MAN,"‘Buddy’ is the definition here; I’m having a guess that it’s MAN for ship, as in MAN o’WAR, coming to the Spanish MAIN.  But that could well be complete and utter bollocks, so elucidation welcomed.
"
1847,Take part in contest and finish 50 short,COMPETE,"COMP[L]ETE, because L is the Latin numeral for 50.
"
1848,"Senior officer needing support squatted, keeping quiet!",BRASS HAT,"Not sure I’d come across this phrase before, but it’s clearly enough indicated: a charade of BRA for ‘support’ followed by an insertion of SH! in SAT for ‘squatted’.

"
1851,Chinese anger about internet facility,SEARCH ENGINE,"This was my clue of the day for its simplicity, but clever and relevant surface, given China’s censorship of online stuff it doesn’t agree with.  anagram of CHINESE ANGER;
"
1852,Board expressing agreement bilingually,OUIJA,"I’ve seen this answer clued similarly before, but this is neat.  Two foreign words for yes – OUI and JA – give you the board which mediums use – allegedly – to contact those on the other side.
"
1853,Noisy party-goers in the middle of hotels making one cross,TRAVERSE,"An insertion of RAVERS for ‘noisy party-goers’ in TE for the middle letters of hoTEls.
"
1854,Tree in China by army ground,PALMYRA,"A charade of PAL for ‘china’ anagram of cockney rhyming slang for ‘china plate’ or ‘mate’) and (ARMY; with ‘ground’ as the anagrind.

"
1857,Music supremo didn’t allow German songs to be heard,BANDLEADER,"A homophone (‘to be heard’) of BANNED and LIEDER, the plural of LIED for the German ‘song’.  This is a bit of a chestnut, but as I’ve said before, I’m not going to be critical of it in a crossword aimed at newer solvers.  Somebody will be solving it for the first time.
"
1858,Revival of firm needing this person (sponsor),COMEBACK,"A charade of CO for ‘firm’, ME for ‘this person’ and BACK for the verbal sense of ‘sponsor’.
"
1859,Herb with old air-gun disturbed maidens,ORIGANUM,"A charade of O, anagram of AIR-GUN; and M for cricketing ‘maidens’ gives you the herb, or strictly herbs, since ORIGANUM is a genus of around twenty herbs, including oregano and marjoram.

1866,Condition of some women in emotional state about ‘the right house’,MOTHERHOOD,"An insertion of THE R HO in MOOD.
"
1867,"Little girl or boy may be upset, being undressed",DISROBED,"I’m not personally mad keen on setters using abbreviated names for ‘little girl’ or ‘little boy’, but that’s just me.  This is a reversal (‘upset’) of DEB OR SID, the famous pairing of Deborah and Sidney.

"
1870,A king’s inscription at the foot of tablet forming a monument?,PILLAR,"This works because it’s a down clue.  PILL is a ‘tablet’, A is I (one) and R is the ‘inscription’ for ‘king’, R(EX).
"
1871,Prominent Indian has a pint rolling over,RAJA,"Quixote’s inviting you to reverse A JAR for ‘a pint’.  ‘I’m going out with the lads tonight for a few jars.’  Which, in fact, I might.
"
1872,A long sentence from Greek letter is made into a book,LIFE OF PI,"A charade of LIFE for ‘a long sentence’, OF for ‘from’ and PI for the Greek letter that’s best known to mathematicians.  Yann Martel’s 2001 novel, which won the Booker Prize.
"
1873,Beat one who acts badly on French sea,HAMMER,"A charade of HAM and MER.
"
1874,Valuable record in good cover,PRECIOUS,"An insertion of REC for ‘record’ in PIOUS.  Not sure that REC is a real abbreviation, but you’ll see it on lots of audio devices.  It’ll be in a dictionary somewhere, no doubt.
"
1875,"Old lady, capturing wildebeest, shows a lot of bottle!",MAGNUM,"Funny (ha-ha, rather than peculiar) surface.  An insertion of GNU in MAM.  Not all mams are old, of course …
"
1876,A comic kind of bird,EAGLE,"A dd.  *The Eagle* was a children’s comic first published in the 1950s.
"
1877,Weekend warriors surround wild party members at front of level crossing,TRAVERSAL,"An insertion of RAVERS into TA (Territorial Army, or ‘weekend warriors’) plus L for the first letter of Level.  What some folk call a ‘lift and separate’ clue, since you have to take ‘level crossing’ apart to make the clue work.
"
1878,Check into an empty Savoy.  It’s close,STICKY,"An insertion of TICK for ‘check’ in SY for ‘Savoy’ emptied of its central letters.
"
1879,Poet’s son writes to the Queen,SPENSER,"A charade of S for ‘son’, PENS for ‘writes’ and ER for Her Maj.  Edmund SPENSER, the 16th century poet, most famous for *The Faerie Queen.*
"
1880,Kit bag’s contents held by Dad’s Army‘s Arthur (formally),MARLOWE,"Another lift and separate clue, and another poet (and playwright, of course).  Kit MARLOWE was a contemporary of Shakespeare and was killed in mysterious circumstances at the age of 29.  I had to leave this overnight before I could parse it.  I’d twigged that the LOWE bit came from Arthur LOWE, who played Captain Mainwaring in the series mentioned (‘Don’t tell him, Pike!’).  It’s A for ‘bag’s contents’ (its middle letter, in other words) in MR LOWE, which is how you would have addressed Arthur ‘formally’.
"
1881,Mean to get home with tuppence short of a shilling,INTEND,"Another nice surface.  Referring back to pre-decimal times before February 1971.  A charade of IN for ‘home’ and TEN D (10d in old money), which was indeed tuppence short of a shilling (which was 12d).
"
1882,Ducks stand in ponds and start to swim in them,SUBMERSES,"‘Ducks’ as a verb is the definition. A charade of SUB for ‘stand-in’ and S for the first letter of ‘swim’ in MERES, or ‘ponds’.  Nice misdirection.
"
1883,Quiet in the back passage!,SHAFT,"That’s good to know.  A charade of SH! for ‘quiet’ and AFT for ‘in the back’.
"
1884,I cry and state “We’re all under the same pressure here!”,ISOBAR,"A charade of I SOB and AR for the two-letter abbreviation for the state of Arizona.
"
1885,Follow goal with a G’n’T cocktail,TAG ALONG,"anagram of GOAL A GNT; with ‘cocktail’ as the anagrind.
"
1886,"Softly, with top priority, without hesitation!",GENTLY,"[UR]GENTLY.  ‘Hesitation’ is usually ER, or UM, but UR works just as well.
"
1887,"Succulent, dark bit of breast turned and even cut in half, in the middle",ALOE VERA,"A bit going on, but cleverly constructed.  The definition is ‘succulent’: Math is inviting you to put EV (‘even cut in half’) in a reversal of AREOLA, the ring of dark skin surrounding human nipples.  Go on, have a look if you don’t believe me.
"
1888,Made extra circuit in front of electronic light to get a little programme installed,LAPPED,"An insertion of APP for ‘a little programme’ in LED for ‘light emitting diode’.
"

"
1892,Sailor resorted to cannibalism.  It finally provides relief,ABATEMENT,"A charade of AB ATE MEN and T for the final letter of iT.
"
1893,Thelonious: first of soul brothers,MONKS,"I needed to look up Thelonious: it’s referring to Thelonious Monk, the US jazz pianist.  So it’s MONK plus S for the first letter of ‘soul’.
"
1894,They go on … they go on walks!,RAMBLERS,"A dd.
"
1895,March to the French bar … that’s sweet!,MARS,"I got fixated with putting one of the French definite articles somewhere, but it’s actually just the French word for the month of March; and of course a MARS bar is sweet.
"
1896,Hang up near thing,CLOSE CALL,"A dd.
"
1897,No pigs are running around this country,SINGAPORE,"anagram of NO PIGS ARE; with ‘running around’ as the anagrind.
"
1898,Breaking up?  Great!,SMASHING,"Another dd.
"
1899,"European, say, chewed a piece of cake",EASY,"A charade of E for ‘European’ and anagram of SAY; with ‘chewed’ as the anagrind.

"
1902,Summit by northern bay,BROWN,"A charade of BROW and N, with the bay being used in the ‘horse’ sense.
"
1903,One in a suit has flat in the London area,SPADE,"An insertion of PAD for ‘flat’ in SE (South-East) for ‘the London area’.
"
1904,Thought of place in instrumental part,REPUTED,"An insertion of PUT for ‘place’ in REED, which would be part of an instrument like the one referred to in 12ac.  ‘He is reputed/thought to have been the best oboist of his generation.’
"
1905,Hide private note,SECRETE,"A charade of SECRET and E for the third note of the scale.
"
1906,Meaning detected in written order,TENOR,"Hidden in writTEN ORder.
"
1907,Right to indicate concession,GOOD POINT,"It’s a concise surface, but newer solvers might (and your humble blogger did) find the definition a bit left-field.  A charade of GOOD for ‘right’ and POINT for ‘indicate’.  If you’re in a discussion with someone and you concede that he or she’s made a counter-argument, you’ll say GOOD POINT!
"
1908,Play with racket,NOISES OFF,"The answer is referring to the 1982 play by Michael Frayn, and again a concise subsidiary indication; but unless I’m missing something, I’m not sure the clue works.  I suppose it’s a kind of &lit, since NOISES OFF is a stage direction for a ‘racket’ to be heard off stage.
"
1909,Large instruments ring out to the end,OBESE,"Nothing wrong with the clue; it’s clever.  But in a Quiptic?  The definition is ‘large’; Beale’s asking you to take the O (‘ring’) out of OB[O]ES and then add the last letter (‘end’) of thE.
"
1910,Bother! The sound system won’t start,ANNOY,"[T]ANNOY.
"
1911,Generous man left to get prong for rake,LIBERTINE,"Sounds like I’m being a bit critical this morning, and other folk may disagree.  This, again, is clever, but is it Quiptic?  The definition is ‘rake’.  You need to find LIBERAL as the definition for ‘generous’ and remove AL for ‘man’.  LIBER[AL] plus TINE for ‘prong’ gives you your answer.
"
1912,"Finding rocks slippery, team has to turn round",CORKSCREW,"Well, the SOED says that CORKSCREW can be a verb, so it’s anagram of ROCKS; plus CREW, with ‘slippery’ as the anagrind.
"
1913,Get change from purse for fine,SUPER,"anagram of PURSE; with ‘get change from’ as the anagrind.  This for me is an excellent clue for a Quiptic: lovely surface reading and clear indication of the route to the solution.
"
1914,"Mountain range is clear example, on reflection",RIDGE,"A charade of RID for ‘clear’ and a reversal (‘on reflection’) of EG.  But surely EG means ‘for example’?
"
1915,Routine step on road for students,TREADMILL,"A charade of TREAD for ‘step’, MI for the M1 motorway, and LL for two learners or ‘students’.
"
1916,Go on to abandon final,LAST DITCH,"A charade of LAST for ‘go on’ and DITCH for ‘abandon’.

1917,Support given to fashionable intellectual,BRAIN,"A charade of BRA for ‘support’ and IN for ‘fashionable’.
"
1918,A refusal to deny unorthodox painkiller,ANODYNE,"A charade of A, NO and anagram of DENY; with ‘unorthodox’ as the anagrind.
"
1919,"In tunnel’s outer confines, animal lurches",TOTTERS,"An insertion of OTTER in TS, the first and last letters of ‘tunnel’s’.
"
1920,Decay reported beneath the building,ROTUNDA,"A charade of ROT for ‘decay’ and UNDA for a homophone (‘reported’) of UNDER.
"
1921,Write to address occupied by single retiree,PENSIONER,"Well, once you’d got some crossing letters, it couldn’t be much else, but there’s a bit cracking off here.  You need to put PEN for ‘write’ in front of an insertion of ONE for ‘single’ in SIR for a form of address.
"
1922,Not long retired back to Home Counties,TERSE,"A word meaning ‘not long’ is a charade of RET reversed (‘back’) and SE for the ‘South-East’ or ‘Home Counties’.  If you don’t like SE for ‘Home Counties’ or ‘London Area’ or ‘Kentish’, get over yourself, because setters use it all the time.
"
1923,Restraint shown by vicar?,DOG COLLAR,"A cd.
"
1924,Follow up apologetic expression with loud joke,SPOOF,"A charade of SPOO for a reversal (‘up’) of OOPS and F for the musical ‘loud’.  ‘Joke’ is the definition.
"
1925,Measure pieces of wood for cabinets,CUPBOARDS,"A charade of CUP for ‘measure’ (‘two cups of flour’) and BOARDS for ‘pieces of wood’ gives you a word whose pronunciation often prompts learners of English to want to go home to mummy for a cuddle and proper food.
"
1926,The best of English literature came at last,ELITE,"A charade of E, LIT and E for the last letter of camE.
"
1927,Top of old meter damaged,EXTREME,"‘Top’ is the definition; it’s EX for ‘old’ and anagram of METER; with ‘damaged’ as the anagrind.
"
1928,Time for a song?,YESTERDAY,"Sir Paul’s composition.  A cd.
"
1929,Old chap’s heading for depression and heart trouble,BOWLER HAT,"A charade of BOWL for ‘depression’ and anagram of HEART;  As to the definition, ‘heading’ is indicating the HAT, but is it only ‘old chaps’ who wear bowlers these days?  In fact, does anyone apart from the bankers in Mary Poppins wear bowlers these days?
"
1930,Secretly finds home with soldier,IN PRIVATE,"A charade of IN and PRIVATE.
"
1931,Fancy collar wrapped round flowery section,COROLLA,"The bright and showy bit of a flower is anagram of COLLAR; around O for ’round’.  ‘Fancy’ is the anagrind and ‘wrapped’ is the insertion indicator.
"
1932,Softens when one abandons story in tears,RELENTS,"An insertion of L[I]E in RENTS.  It’s the verbal sense of ‘tear’ and ‘abandons’ is the indication that you need to take I out of LIE for ‘story’.
"
1933,Dance made up of two circles,DISCO,"A charade of DISC and O.
"
1934,Raise it with the amount once taxed,TITHE,"A charade of IT reversed (‘raise’) and THE to give you the word for an old church tax, based on a tenth of your income, if memory serves (and it doesn’t always these days …)
"
1935,First performance of complex duet without book,DEBUT,"An insertion anagram of ‘without’) of B in (DUET; with ‘complex’ as the anagrind.
"
1936,Snub former US president suppressing right of female,BRUSH,"-OFFThe nounal (in other words hyphenated) form of the answer is an insertion (‘suppressing’) of R for ‘right’ in BUSH for ‘former president’ (take your pick) followed by OF and F for ‘female’.
"
1937,Virginia Lake and Greek character dance,VALETA,"A charade of VA for the two-letter abbreviation for the US state of Virginia, L for ‘lake’ and ETA for the Greek letter.
"
1938,Cleaner circumspect about boy,CHARLADY,"An insertion of LAD for ‘boy’ in CHARY for ‘circumspect’.
"
1939,Craft’s required to catch small crows,BOASTS,"Another insertion (‘to catch’) of S for ‘small’ in BOATS for ‘craft’s; you need to remember that punctuation, including apostrophes, is ignored.
"
1940,Disease may make one feel very low,YELLOW FEVER,"I thought this was really clever: it’s anagram of FEEL VERY LOW; and ‘may make one’ is the anagrind.
"
1941,Page clergyman shortly,RECTO,"If a RECTO[R] had his bottom bitten off, he’d end up as a version of a page.
"
1942,Training college and sanatorium close to old wood,SANDHURST,"A charade of SAN for ‘sanatorium’, D for the last letter of olD, and HURST for ‘wood’.  The ‘wood’ definition I vaguely knew, and I’m guessing it’s the reason why so many English place names end in HURST.
"
1943,Refuse to abandon one’s opinion of partnership at company,STAND FIRM,"A cleverly worded clue to indicate that you should put STAND for a cricket ‘partnership’ before FIRM for ‘company’.
"
1944,"Right about crops, primarily barley",TRUCE,"I hope it took you as long to solve and parse this as it did me.  My last one in, and even with the crossing letters, I was struggling to work it out.  It’s an insertion of C for the first letter of ‘crops’ in TRUE for ‘right’.  It was the definition that threw me: I didn’t know that BARLEY is a word that children use to indicate that there should be a truce, or time-out to use a basketball term, in a game.  It’s a variant on the pirate phrase PARLAY, which you’ll have heard a lot if you’ve watched *Pirates of the Caribbean* (and which comes from the French *parler*, ‘to speak’).
"
1945,"Knight, leading small number in rear, controlled fire in battle",BANNOCKBURN,"Easier to solve than to parse, I found.  An insertion of N for Knight (in chess) followed by NO for ‘small number’ in BACK for ‘rear’; all followed by BURN for ‘controlled fire’.
"
1946,Want the Parisian to give a pointer,NEEDLE,"A charade of NEED for ‘want’ and LE for one of the French definite articles.

"
1950,Reverse taxi over top of kerb,BACK,"Everyman’s inviting you to put a reversal of CAB in front of the first letter of Kerb to give you your answer.
"
1951,State without a highway? Not all of it,UTAH,"Hidden in withoUT A Highway.
"
1952,Buddy attached to golf club in LA?,HOLLYWOOD,"A charade of HOLLY and WOOD for Tinseltown.  Buddy HOLLY died in a plane crash, giving the inspiration for Don McLean’s *American Pie*; and WOOD is a golf club.
"
1953,Bilge in bows?,FIDDLESTICKS,"A dd, relying on the fact that ‘bows’ can be pronounced two ways.
"
1954,Apart from a cold dessert served up,ALOOF,"A synonym for standoffish is a charade of A and a reversal of FOOL for ‘dessert’ (as in gooseberry fool).

"
1956,Returns hat lost in Scottish resort,ANSTRUTHER,"anagram of RETURNS HAT; with ‘lost’ as the anagrind.
"
1957,One out and about after retiring?,SOMNAMBULIST,"A cd, and Everyman doesn’t do many of them, so appreciate this one.
"
1958,Groups of musicians may bring money belts,BRASS BANDS,"I was into the territory of anagram of MONEY BELTS; at first; but it’s a charade of BRASS for ‘money’ and BANDS for ‘belts’.
"
1959,Skinniest wins crates (bubbly),SCRAWNIEST,"anagram of WINS CRATES; with ‘bubbly’ as the anagrind.
"
1960,"Type of road accident caused by him, initially, Italian with ladder",HIT,"-AND-RUNThe solution was clear from the enumeration, but it took me a while to see that it was a charade of H for the first letter of
"
1961,Hardy dog with no lead?,OLLIE,"We’re not in *Tess* or *Jude* territory here.  The clue is referring to Oliver (Ollie) Hardy of Laurel and Hardy fame, and is [C]OLLIE.
"
1962,Expensive honey,DEAR,"A dd.
"
1963,Feel sorry for mine and yours at first,PITY,"A charade of PIT for ‘mine’ and Y for the first letter of ‘yours’.
"
1964,"Boss, between 4 and 6, is practically useless?",HEAD IN THE CLOUDS,"I had a guess once I’d created a few crossing letters; but once you’d got 4 and 6 (NIMBUS and CUMULUS) then it’s HEAD for ‘boss’ and IN THE CLOUDS, for someone who’s a bit dizzy and no good at everyday stuff.
"
1965,School ideology creating division,SCHISM,"A charade of SCH for ‘school’ and ISM for the not very convincing definition (yes, I know it’s in dictionaries) of ‘ideology’.  CREATIONISM, DARWINISM, BLAIRISM and so on. The SCHI prefix comes originally from the Greek word for ‘split’ and you’ll find it in words like SCHIZOPHRENIA (literally ‘split mind’, although that’s not really what it is) and SCHIST (‘split rock’).  And, if it’s not too much information for a Monday morning, in what you might do if you were in a private cubicle next to a 24ac.
"
1966,One’s protected by one’s … one’s exemption,IMMUNITY,"I was never going to get this without all the crossing letters: the definition is ‘exemption’ and it’s an insertion (‘protected’) of UNIT for ‘one’ in I’M for ‘one’s’ and MY for ‘one’s’.  I think.
"
1967,"Joey maybe messes up at one-all, getting dismissed finally",MARSUPIAL,"The little bouncy fellow is a charade of MARS for ‘messes’, UP and I AL[L].
"
1968,Phone enquiry to personnel department in Dortmund area?,RUHR,"Texting, texting, texting … they’re all at it, these young whippersnapper setters, even though texting is so twentieth-century.  A charade of RU for text-speak ‘are you’ and HR for ‘Human Resources’, for the more modern name for the Personnel Department.  Dortmund is on the River RUHR, in a major German industrial area of the same name.
"
1969,Spice said to make an entrée,CUMIN,"Cue homophone debate, perhaps, unless I’m missing something.  It’s CUMIN the spice, said to sound like COME IN, an ‘entrée’.  First off, for me the clue doesn’t unequivocally tell you which way round the homophone works.  Second, I have always said CUE – MIN rather than CUM – IN, so please don’t tell me I’ve been pronouncing it wrong for all these years.  But I do know that cumin seeds scattered sparingly over buttered baby carrots certainly does the business as one of the side dishes for the Sunday roast.
"
1970,Breakfast items that man will finish,EGGSHELL,"Great surface: a charade of EGGS and HE’LL for the paint.
"
1971,Where Irish politicians are found covering Egypt thoroughly,IN DETAIL,"The Irish parliament has been centre stage recently: Phi used DAIL in his Friday puzzle last week.  Irish members are found in the DAIL (pronounced ‘doyle’ and I think it has an accent on it) and if you insert ET for an abbreviation of Egypt you’ve got your answer.  ‘Thoroughly’ is the definition.
"
1972,Where one’s taken for intimacy – being single’s best part?,ASIDE,"If a member of the opposite sex asked you to come aside, you might expect some intimacy, I suppose; and those old enough to remember ‘singles’ will know that the best track was always on the A-SIDE.
"
1973,Chain letter,MAIL,"A dd.
"
1974,Runs by uncovered chicken coops becoming homes for vermin,RATTERIES,"Never heard of it, but it’s R for cricket ‘runs’ followed by [B]ATTERIES.
"
1975,"Irish party with a bit of leg on show, it’s rumoured",SINN FEIN,"We’re having some homophones (in this case, ‘it’s rumoured’) this morning.  Can’t argue with this one, though: ‘shin’ for ‘bit of leg’ and ‘feign’ for ‘show’ gives you the Irish political party whose name in English means ‘we alone’ or ‘we ourselves’.
"
1976,One of four in a lavatory?,URINAL,"Hidden in foUR IN A Lavatory.  I think this is an &lit, since it’s entirely possible that there would be four URINALS in a gents.
"
1977,We’re groaning with heat after a bit of a storm when cycling – sick of such problems?,UNDER THE WEATHER,"This is what I meant when I said that it was easier to solve than parse.  More meteorological references: Morph is asking you to make an anagram of anagram of WERE HEAT; with ‘groaning’ as the anagrind after THUNDER for ‘a bit of a storm’ with the first two letters (TH) ‘cycled’ to the end to give you UNDER TH.
"
1978,Maybe text from old flame results in expulsion from church,EXCOMMUNICATION,"More text.  If the girlfriend had given you the brown envelope and then was subsequently in touch, it would be EX COMMUNICATION.
"
1979,River south of airless Scottish town getting less rainfall,DRIER,"[AIR]DRIE plus R for ‘river’.
"
1980,Sunrise introducing a small amount of atmospheric pressure – it could bring rain,NIMBUS,"A reversal (‘rise’, since it’s a down clue) of SUN with an insertion of IMB for 1 millibar, a unit of atmospheric pressure.  And NIMBUS clouds can indeed bring rain, often heavy.  It was also the name for Harry Potter’s Quidditch broomstick.
"
1981,Precipitation in central parts of ridge heading north – outlook for short range,HAILING DISTANCE,"A charade of HAIL for ‘precipitation’, IN, GDI,  a reversal (‘heading north’ in a down clue) of IGD for the central letters of rIDGe, and STANCE for ‘outlook’.  The definition is ‘short range’: if someone is within HAILING DISTANCE, then they are in short enough range to hear you without artificial aids.  If this were the Cruciverbal Olympics, Morph would perhaps not medal (sorry) in the Conciseness for Clueing race.  But the surface is good and if you follow the instructions you’ll get to the answer.
"
1982,Sky coverage increasing steadily – 50 per cent of country,CUMULUS,"More clouds, or ‘sky coverage’.  A charade of CUMUL[ATING] and US for ‘country’.
"
1983,"Trouble in new roles is common, perhaps",OWNERLESS,"The definition is ‘common’.  It’s anagram of NEW ROLES; followed by S for ‘is’ as in it’S.  ‘Trouble’ is the anagrind.
"
1984,"Suffering such mal, trees died right away",DUTCH ELM DISEASE,"A kind of &lit.  anagram of SUCH MAL T[R]EES DIED;  ‘Suffering’ is the anagrind and ‘right away’ is inviting you to remove the R from the anagram fodder.  Lovely clue.

1985,Popular benefit cut initially introduced to North East not doing anything?,INDOLENCE,"A charade of IN for ‘popular’, DOLE for ‘benefit’ plus an insertion of C for the first letter of ‘cut’ in NE.
"

"
1987,"Get off toboggan, perhaps, in flood",DELUGE,"This is outrageous, but funny.  If you were competing in the Winter Olympics in the LUGE, and you got off after finishing, you would DE-LUGE.
"
1988,Foolish character with what should be on top underneath and either side,IDIOT,"I regret to say that I have absolutely no idea how this works.  But somebody out there will put me out of my misery before long, I’m sure.
"
1989,Shoe seaman’s wearing very tight originally,SABOT,"An insertion of AB for ‘sailor’ in SO and T.

2188,"Innocent?  Got hitched up before end of July, I’d heard",DEWY,"-EYEDAn adjective that’s certainly in my passive vocabulary but which I probably have never used.  Again, because it’s a down clue, it’s a reversal of WED, Y for the last letter of JulY and EYED for a homophone of ‘I’d’.
"
2189,Discipline: something learnt at school,SCIENCE,"A dd, but I thought this was one weak clue in an otherwise excellent puzzle.
"
2190,In church hold back a few coins,CHANGE,"An insertion of HANG for ‘hold back’ in CE for ‘church’.
"
2191,Wanting writer to rise in sex appeal,INEPT,"Yet another down clue trick: an insertion of NEP for a reversal of PEN, ‘writer’ in IT for ‘sex appeal’.

"
2193,Of Mice and Men novel gripping spoon-bender,MURINE,"Well, if you’re going to learn a new word, it might as well be 1 Across.  In the same way that URSINE is descriptive of bears and LUPINE is of wolves, MURINE is the mousey equivalent.  An insertion anagram of ‘gripping’) of URI (Geller) in (MEN;  ‘Novel’ is the anagrind.
"
2194,"One’s captivated by a desire for the taste of Pernod, perhaps?",ANISEED,"An insertion (‘captivated’) of I’S for ‘one’s) in A NEED.  Just the smell of Pernod makes me want to chunder.

"
2196,TimeWarner panic to fix copyright infringement,ALARM CLOCK,"TimeWarner is the media and entertainment giant (and its name is so spelled on its own website).  The whimsical definition is ‘Time Warner’, and it’s an insertion of C for ‘copyright’ in ALARM for ‘panic’ and LOCK for ‘fix’.  ‘Infringement’ just about works as the insertion indicator, I think.
"
2197,An automotive service is established in the old part of Europe,THRACE,"An insertion of RAC in THE.  The ancient Balkan region.
"
2198,"Ostentatious ayatollah did a Hajj, setting off late and finishing early",LAH,"-DI-DAHHidden in ayatolLAH DID A Hajj.

"
2202,One filling prescription for future Princess of Wales after Charlie left for first of suitors,DISPENSER,"The Princess that the *Daily Mail* and *Daily Express* are still grieving over was DI(ana) SPENCER.  Rorschach is asking you to replace the C (Charlie) in the phonetic alphabet with S for the first letter of ‘suitors’.
"
2203,"More problematic than Gordius, perhaps?",KNOTTIER,"Bit of an in-joke, but you didn’t have to know that Gordius is a regular setter in *The Guardian*.  He has his fans; I’m not one of them.  Referring to the Gordian knot.
"
2204,The Prime Minister doesn’t take on a media producer,CAMERA,"CAMER[ON] plus A.
"
2205,Lines of speech?,VOCAL CORDS,"A cd cum dd, I suppose, with CORDS and ‘lines’ being synonymous.
"
2206,Infusion of turmeric enhances this?,RICE,"Clever clue, and semi &lit, I guess.  Hidden in turmeRIC Enhances.  ‘Infusion’ is the hidden indicator.  A bit of Star Anise and a few cloves also do the business, despite what I said at 4ac.
"
2207,A German encrypted a number?,CODEINE,"This was my favourite today; I thought it was really inventive.  It’s ‘number’ in the anaesthetic sense, and is EIN (‘a’ in German) in CODE.  And if EIN is ‘in code’, it’s encrypted.
"
2208,Almost all the French in disarray,TOUSLE,"The setter’s being very precise with his cluing and with his French grammar: TOUSLE[S].  TOUS LES is one option for ‘all the’ in French: *tous les enfants sont méchants*.  And if you use TOUS, it has to be followed by LES and not LE, because it’s plural.
"
2209,Hit back and lash out at an officer,MARSHAL,"A reversal of RAM followed by anagram of LASH;
"
2210,European agreement to support port wine region,RIOJA,"Since it’s a down clue, it’s JA for the German word for ‘yes’ below RIO, the setters’ fave port.

"
2216,"A best friend of Kierkegaard, perhaps?",GREAT DANE,"Now the Danish make an appearance: Søren Aabye Kierkegaard was a nineteenth century Danish philosopher and theologian, and could rightly be described as a GREAT DANE.  History doesn’t record whether he had a dog, but if he had, it could easily have been one of these.

"
2219,Anarche mistakenly omits noun at conclusion of puzzle resulting in a complaint to The Listener,EARACHE,"For crossword obsessives who know the names of all their setters, this would appeal; but for the majority who don’t know or don’t care about who’s produced the puzzle, it might have been a bit strange, with them thinking that it was a misprint for ‘Arachne’.  It’s clear enough, though: anagram of A[N]ARCHE; and E for the last letter of ‘puzzlE’.  ‘Mistakenly’ is the anagrind.
"
2220,Source of climate change drastically cut down raincoat production,AIR,"-CONAs far as I can see, this is anagram of RAINCO[AT]; with ‘production’ as the anagrind.  But I’m not mad about clues like this: how ‘drastically’ do you want me to cut down ‘raincoat’?  One letter, two letters …   But AIR-CON is certainly a contributing factor to climate change.  I was reading the other day that the US uses more energy keeping cool in the summer than keeping warm in the winter.
"
2221,Communist broadcast!?,MARKS,"The horrible double punctuation marks at the end of the clue are the key to this one: they are an exclamation mark and a question mark, and MARKS is a homophone (‘broadcast’) of Karl MARX, the German-born philosopher who is buried in Highgate cemetery.
"
2222,Protection for small area with scrubby vegetation,SHEATH,"A charade of S and HEATH.
"
2223,"Bert and a model going in to marry, having something on which to consummate the union?",WATER BED,"An insertion anagram of ‘going in to’) of (BERT A; in WED for ‘marry’.  ‘Model’ is the anagrind.  Let’s hope they used a 1 across.
"
2224,Work into dodgy brie with initially advantageous micro-organisms,BACTERIA,"Another insertion: of ACT for ‘work’ in anagram of BRIE; plus A for the first letter of ‘advantageous’.  And Pan correctly marks ‘bacteria’ as plural; if one more person on the BBC says ‘the bacteria is …’ I may not be responsible for my actions.

"
2235,"In flat marshy land, a drained settlement is secure",FASTEN,"Again, one that was probably easier to solve than to parse.  FEN is ‘flat marshy land’; if you insert (‘in’) A and ST for the outside letters (‘drained’) of ‘settlement’ then you’ve got your answer.  ‘Secure’ is the definition.
"
2236,"Restore body part, reportedly",HEAL,"A homophone (‘reportedly’) of HEEL.

"
2255,"Cocktails and mixed gins at either side of Pearl, so drunk",SINGAPORE SLINGS,"A triple anagram construction: Everyman’s proposing that you put anagram of PEARL SO; inside anagram of GINS; twice.  Probably one that most solvers would have got from a few crossing letters and then working backwards from there, I fancy.  ‘Mixed’ and ‘drunk’ are the anagrinds.

2487,"Recalled, after doctoring, nursing home, a success in the end?",CINDERELLA,"I did get this finally, and it’s a bit of a whimsical definition: CINDERELLA was of course a ‘success in the end’, since she married Prince Charming and lived happily ever after.  So it’s an insertion anagram of ‘nursing’) of IN in (RECALLED; with ‘after doctoring’ as the anagrind.
"
2488,Political group reduced offer to college in New York,TENDENCY,"I struggled with this one until I got the crossing letters, though as I said in the pre-amble, I can’t now see why.  A ‘reduced offer’ is TENDE[R], and then you have to put C for ‘college’ in NY for the Big Apple.
"
2489,Delivery signal after break ends early,RESCUE,"I was into cricket for a long time, looking for some umpire’s signal.  But that was rubbish: it’s ‘delivery’ as a noun and is CUE after RES[T].
"
2490,Din from hooter I stopped,NOISE,"Lovely surface.  An insertion of I in NOSE for ‘hooter’.
"
2491,Big attraction of publication isn’t me unfortunately!,MAGNETISM,"I think Raich is being a bit self-deprecating here.  We all buy the IoS because of the crosswords, don’t we?  Any road up, it’s MAG for ‘publication’ followed by anagram of ISN’T ME; with ‘unfortunately’ as the anagrind.
"
2492,Ruin I passably reinterpreted with participation of lecturer here?,SALISBURY PLAIN,"anagram of RUIN I PASSABLY L; with ‘reinterpreted’ as the anagrind.  I think the setter is aiming for a semi&lit, and Stonehenge, which is on SALISBURY PLAIN, is a ‘ruin’ in its broadest sense, but perhaps I’ve not parsed this precisely.
"
2493,Refined aunt reusing set theme songs,SIGNATURE TUNES,"anagram of AUNT REUSING SET; with ‘refined’ as the anagrind.
"
2494,Girl in Tenerife getting up,IRENE,"Hidden reversed in efIRENEt.

"
2501,"Party game requires subtle diplomacy at first, nothing lacking",PLAID CYMRU,"This is what some folk refer to as a ‘lift and separate’ clue.  Nothing to do with bras: Raich is putting in your head ‘party game’ as a concept, but the definition is in fact ‘party’.  Then it’s RU for the setters’ favourite ‘game’ anagram of Rugby Union) preceded by (DIPL[O]MACY; with ‘subtle’ as the anagrind and ‘nothing lacking’ as the removal indicator.  PLAID CYMRU is a Welsh political party.
"
2502,Note agents entering decisive contest about money,FINANCIAL,"‘About money’ is the definition; an insertion of N CIA in FINAL.
"
2503,Power to support liberal group of countries defending zone in bad weather,FREEZE,"-UPThere’s a bit going on here as well.  I parsed it as P for ‘power’ supporting (in a down clue) FREE EU for ‘liberal, group of countries’ including Z for ‘zone’.  Not sure I’ve seen Z for ‘zone’ before, but it’ll be somewhere as an abbreviation.
"
2504,"In interlude from duties, referring to Church’s Saints",RECESS,"‘Interlude from duties’ can certainly be defined as RECESS in parliamentary terms.  Nadine Dorries has taken this definition to a new level.  This is, I think, RE for ‘referring to’, CES for ‘church’s’ and S for ‘saints’.  Or it could be CE for ‘church’ and SS for ‘saints’.
"
2505,Republic’s friend,CHINA,"This is an entry-level clue and it was still one of my last in.  A dd.  CHINA is indeed a republic and it’s also Cockney rhyming slang for ‘mate’ or ‘friend’, coming from CHINA PLATE.
"
2506,Repulsive using lady – heartless,UGLY,"A charade of the outside letters (‘heartless’) of UsinG LadY.
"
2507,Autumn turns out to provide unexpected gains,WINDFALLS,"A dd.  The fruit that you’d find on the ground after the first few winds of autumn is a word for something that you weren’t expecting financially.

"
2544,Chemical splattered around – absorbed finally for removal,SALTPETRE,"(SPLATTERE[D])  I did not do the timeliness of this blog or my temper much good by stupidly entering SALTPETER to start with.  It is an alternative spelling, in my defence.

"
2562,Dwarf planet that is submerged under water,PLUTO,"I have absolutely no idea …
"
2563,Cheerful bishop’s flexible,BLITHE,"A charade of B and LITHE.  Perhaps appropriately for Everyman’s Sunday puzzle, this put me in mind of the old nursery rhyme:

"
2565,"Liqueur price list outrageous – expensive, ultimately, for one",TRIPLE SEC,"I wasn’t helped here by the fact that I don’t do liqueurs, ‘cos I’m not posh enough.  But it’s anagram of PRICE LIST; with E for the last letter of ‘expensive’ substituted for I (‘one’).

"
2569,E.g. neck ends?,CLOSE FINISH,"It’s clever, but perhaps a bit too tricksy for Everyman solvers; or maybe I’m dumbing them down.  Anyway, it was my last one in.  The definition is ‘Eg neck’ and it’s to do with horseracing, where to win ‘by a neck’ is a CLOSE FINISH.  And of course CLOSE and FINISH are two words for ‘ends’.
"
2570,Exactly how rent is paid?,TO THE LETTER,"A cd cum dd.
"
2571,Note journalists keep back,REPRESS,"The second letter of the sol-fa, RE, is followed by PRESS, much in the news recently with the Levenson enquiry.

2593,Grandma not available to collect girl,NANNA,"An insertion of ANN in N/A for ‘not available’.
"
2594,Sounds expensive to maintain the earliest pit in Settle,DETERMINE,"A homophone of ‘dear’ includes T for the first letter of ‘the’ and is followed by MINE.  Settle, in the historical West Riding of Yorkshire, has never had a pit, but it seems to be providing us with a little mini-theme throughout the puzzle.

"
2601,Approves of temporary living quarters,DIGS,"A dd.
"
2602,Co-operating with Cuban on getting up-to-date,CONCURRENT,"A charade of C for ‘Cuban’, ON and CURRENT.  For me CONCURRENT means something different; but dictionaries give the ‘co-operating with’ definition, so fair enough.
"

"
2604,Deserter caught in the centre of Kiev is furious,IRATE,"An insertion of RAT for ‘deserter’ in the central letters of Kiev.

"
2611,Harry Percy was one sexy leader,HOTHEAD,"Not entirely sure here, but it seems to be a charade of HOT and HEAD.  Harry (Henry) Percy was Duke of Northumberland, but why he is a ‘hothead’, I can’t work out.  However, a market charter for the town of Settle was granted to one Henry Percy in 1249.
"
2612,Work on reduction of colour in blood,GORE,"A charade of GO and RE[D].  It’s not working/it’s not going.

2613,Mentally acute for a beer drinking soldier,AGILE,"An insertion of GI in ALE.
"
2614,Lead piping originally found in burn by principal,SPEARHEAD,"Another clue where you need to ‘lift and separate’.  The definition is ‘lead’ in its verbal sense: it’s an insertion of P for the first letter of ‘piping’ in
"
2615,It may be paid for impudence over domestic’s duties,LIP SERVICE,"A charade of LIP and SERVICE.
"
2616,General takes part in fierce verbal attack,BROADSIDE,"BROAD is another word for ‘general’, and I suppose that a SIDE is ‘a part’?
"
2617,Missile causes an explosion engulfing Romeo sadly,BOOMERANG,"An insertion of anagram of ROMEO; in BANG.  I was misled initially by thinking that Romeo would be R, the letter it represents in the phonetic alphabet.
"
2618,One on hand mostly to protect soldiers against a source of radioactivity,THORIUM,"It’s a help that most radioactive elements end in -IUM, but this was still tricky to solve and parse.  It’s an insertion of OR (‘other ranks’) and I for ‘a’ in THUM[B].
"
2619,Strongly contrasting details about space incorporated by performers,ACCENTS,"Another insertion, of C for ‘circa’ or ‘about’ and EN for the printers’ space in ACTS.
"
2620,Intend to persuade volunteers to return,GET AT,"The definition is ‘intend’, as in ‘what are you getting at?’  Then I’m assuming it’s GET and a reversal of TA for ‘volunteers’, but how we get from GET to ‘persuade’ I’m not sure.
"
2621,The first woman holding one of them,THEIR,"The possessive form of ‘they’ is yet another insertion of I for ‘one’ in THE and R for ‘Regina’ (again) for ‘Queen’, who some – not including me – would consider to be the ‘first woman’.  At least when Catherine drops the sprog it’ll have an equal chance of succeeding to the throne, unlike the present incumbent.
"
2622,Philosopher’s works,MILL,"John Stuart MILL, who on half a pint of shandy was particularly ill, if you’re a Python fan.  And another reference – I think – to Settle, which was a big textile town back in its day.  No doubt at some stage they had trouble at t’mill.
"
2623,"Some soldier perhaps finding God, peace non-starter",THORAX,"I invariably start with the first across clue but quickly gave up on this one.  I eventually got it with only a few left.  It’s a charade of THOR for the Norse God who’s responsible for Thursday being the fourth day of our week, and [P]AX for the Latin word for ‘peace’ (as in *Pax Vobiscum* for all you lapsed Catholics out there) without its first letter.  The definition is ‘some soldier perhaps’.  A ‘soldier’ is an ANT and an ant, like all the members of the class *Insecta,* has three body parts: a head, a thorax and an abdomen.  So a THORAX is some part of an ant.  Why do compilers set the hardest clues for the first across?
"
2624,"Highest range making cock a hen, by the sound of it?",HIMALAYA,"Typical Punk, which raised a smile once I’d cracked it.  I was fixated with HIMALAYAS, which is what we’d normally call the range in English, so couldn’t see it for a while.  But if you decided to make a cockerel a hen, you’d make ‘him a layer’.
"
2625,Tribute as drink’s consumed,TOAST,"An insertion of AS in TOT for ‘drink’, and an &lit, or ‘all-in-one’ clue.
"
2626,Those once charting the fall of apartheid,HIT PARADE,"anagram of APARTHEID; with ‘the fall of’ as the anagrind and a reference to the dizzy heights of the 1970s when we all waited anxiously once a week to see who would be top of the charts.  Happy days.
"
2627,"Number proceed quickly, neither straight _____ for the 9-n guide",TENZING NORGAY,"I do like a good surface, but for me this isn’t one.  I thought at first it might be a misprint for 9dn, but there is no 9dn.   Punk occasionally uses this _____ device, which I personally think is best left to the quick crossword.  9-n is asking you to put N on the end of HIMALAYA to make HIMALAYAN and the HIMALAYAN GUIDE is TENZING NORGAY: a charade of TEN, ZING and somebody who’s neither straight NOR GAY.  In fact, imho the whole thing is nonsense.  Perhaps not one of Punk’s most elegant clues.
"
2628,Element that’s consuming god,IODINE,"An insertion of ODIN for another Norse god in IE for that is,* id est*.  A halogen, and the tincture that surgeons rub on you before they slice you open, leaving you with purplish stains for days afterwards.
"
2629,"Tour tiny empty church, viewing work of art",TRIPTYCH,"A charade of TRIP for ‘tour’, TY for ‘tiny’ emptied of its middle letters, and CH.  A TRIPTYCH is a painting made up of three sections.
"
2630,"Another handle turning fat, one for the barbie?",SOBRIQUET,"The definition is ‘another handle’ with ‘handle’ in its ‘name’ definition.  Then it’s a reversal of OS for ‘fat’ and BRIQUET.  I’d always spell it BRIQUETTE, but Punk’s variation is in dictionaries, so as our Australian barbie fans would say: no worries (and pass me another tinnie).
"
2631,Just delivered a short story on gas,NEONATAL,"A charade of A TAL[E] after NEON.
"
2632,Redial incorrectly to come off the line,DERAIL,"anagram of REDIAL; with ‘incorrectly’ as the anagrind.
"
2633,"Christ the Redeemer, perhaps, about right height",STATURE,"Punk is referring to the imposing STATUE of Christ above Rio de Janeiro, and asking you to put an R in it to get your answer.
"
2634,"was in this underwear touring political division, and topless",HOWARDS END,"VANESSA REDGRAVE was one of the main characters in HOWARDS END, the 1992 film based on E M Forster’s novel.  It’s an insertion of WARD for ‘political division’ in HOSE for ‘underwear’ followed by [A]ND.  HOSE in this sense is not really heard in modern British English, but if you’re familiar with the traditional song *The Lyke-Wake Dirge*, then you’ll remember
"
2635,"If ever thou gavest hosen and shoon,", S,it thee down and put them on
2636,"Dreamer’s island funny, as Spooner would say",WALTER MITTY,"My least favourite clue type, but that’s just me.  A suggested Spoonerism of MALTA WITTY for the fictional fantasist.
"
2637,Thoughtless having wine on cruise ship captain finally abandoned,CAVALIER,"A charade of CAVA for the sparkling wine and LI[N]ER.
"
2638,Knock up a soldier,PARA,"More Punk smut.  Since it’s a down clue, it’s a reversal of RAP and A.
"
2639,"Current indicators on sex appeal, and socialist, serious actress",VANESSA REDGRAVE,"Well, she could certainly be described as a socialist and a serious actress.  A charade of VANES for ‘current indicators’, SA, RED and GRAVE.
"

2881,They’re enthusiastic in a game set up among friends,AMATEURS,"Definition: They’re enthusiastic

‘All for one and one for all’ was the musketeers’ cry.  If you put C for ‘cold’ in the second part you’ve got your answer, although I personally would always say ONCE AND FOR ALL, so I’m not rightly sure what’s cracking off here.

‘Style’ is GENRE; if you remove the R (‘right away’) then you’ve got the unit of heredity which does indeed convey characteristics from one generation to the next.  This requires sex, which makes it even more fun.

A charade of OFF for ‘disappointing’ (‘she’s having an off day’) and DRIVE for ‘press’ (forward).  The answer is cricket-related; only trouble at t’mill is that I would always write it OFF DRIVE (or at least OFF-DRIVE) and all my dictionaries agree with me.  Shane Warne didn’t bowl LEGBREAKS and Swanny doesn’t bowl OFFBREAKS.

3207,"Maybe weeping tree, say, one’s put outside institute",PLAINTIVE,"Definition: Maybe weeping
I can’t quite make this work.  It appears to be a charade of PLAIN for a homophone of PLANE, the tree; then I can see that I’VE could be ‘one’s’ in the sense of  ‘one has’.  But where the T fits in I can’t see.
"
3208,"Column‘s style and hairdo tips costly, for the most part",DORIC,"Definition: Column

"
3217,Capital increasing by itself when account’s maintained,UPPER,"Definition: Capital
-CASEWell, my best stab at this is that it’s a charade of UP for ‘increasing’, and an insertion of CA for ‘current account’ in PER SE.  But that could well be complete balls.

"
3220,Queen of hearts tucking into frozen tart,QUICHE,"Definition: tart
A charade of QU and an insertion of H in ICE.  What real men don’t eat.

3242,It’s not fair raising tax on only one church,INJUSTICE,"Definition: It’s not fair

"
3252,Little bit of criticism snootily expressed?,FLECK,"Definition: Little bit
I don’t like this in a Quiptic and I wouldn’t have much liked it in a weekday cryptic.  It’s relying on the fact that people like the Queen (or those with Received Pronunciation or RP, although let’s not go there because it’s going out of fashion) would pronouce FLAK like FLECK.  This trick is usually seen to clue GIRL for GEL, or the other way round.  Personally, I’d consign it to the cruciverbal dustbin.

"
3325,PVC component your old boy put in within limits of estimate,ETHYLENE,"Definition: PVC component
An insertion of THY for the old word for ‘your’ and LEN for ‘boy’ in EE, the outside letters of EstimatE.  I personally can’t be doing with LEN and other abbreviations of male names for ‘boy’, but that’s crosswordspeak.  ETHYLENE is indeed a component in the manufacture of PVC, giving vinyl chloride monomer, which when polymerised, gives polyvinyl chloride, the tree-huggers’ least favourite plastic.  If they’re that bothered, they should refuse the next transfusion they’re offered from a PVC blood bag, since the medical industry is one of the main end-users of the product.

"
3331,Stay inside always retiring in comfort,RELIEVE,"Definition: comfort
I started off by thinking that this was an insertion of VEIL in E’ER for ‘always’ reversed, but I couldn’t see the equivalence of VEIL and STAY.  In fact it’s an insertion of LIE in EVER reversed.
"
3332,"Help for climber very inclined to lose heart, left hanging over the summer",STEPLADDER,"Definition: Help for climber
A charade of ST[E]EP, L and ADDER for ‘summer’.
"
3333,Newspaper articles for such as the Standard?,COLUMNS,"Definition: Newspaper articles
A dd, I think, although I can’t explain it fully.  Standard is a flag, column is a flagpole?  Thought not.
"
3334,"Drunk a beer after taking ecstasy, requiring service to imbibe again",REABSORB,"Definition: to imbibe again
I’m not overly keen on the definition.  Whatever, Crosophile is asking you to take E out of ‘a beer’, make an anagram to get REAB, then add SORB, which as we all know is the fruit of the service tree, *Sorbus domestica*.
"
3335,"Make light work – to repeat, it’s broken",OPERETTA,"Definition:  light work
anagram of TO REPEAT;
"
3336,She studied a compound with sodium,ALUMNA,"Definition: She studied
A charade of ALUM, a compound (mostly referring to the hydrated form of potassium aluminium sulphate) and NA for the chemical symbol for ‘sodium’.  The feminine form, from the Latin, of ALUMNUS, for a former student.  Should you ever need them in future crosswords, the plurals are ALUMNI and ALUMNAE.
"
3337,"Dog held up fleece, one ounce over",BORZOI,"Definition: Dog
A charade of a reversal of ROB and I OZ.  I don’t do dogs, so I can’t tell you what it looks like.  But it sounds scary.
"
3338,In Woodstock we are this – spin record for East of Eden,GOLDEN,"Definition: this 
See 7dn.  A charade of a reversal of LOG for ‘record’ and DEN for the ‘east’ of ‘Eden’.  As for the second part of the charade: hmmm …
"
3339,Second drink and a kiss and a cuddle,SNOG,"Definition: kiss and a cuddle
A charade of S and NOG.  I felt in need of a cuddle when I finally sorted this puzzle out.  But from a woman rather than a member of Gay Rabbit, of course.
"
3340,Object to joke about inhabitants of funny farm?,LAUGHING STOCK,"Definition: Object to jokeabout inhabitants of funny farm
A dd cum cd: if you are the object of a joke, then you’re a LAUGHING STOCK; and if cows were funny, they’d be LAUGHING STOCK too.  There is of course the French cheese, *La Vache qui Rit*, which in English is branded as *The Laughing Cow*.
"
3341,Old Labour PM dropping ecstasy in posh car – I’m shaken!,RATTLER,"Definition: I’m shaken
The posh car is, as always, RR for Rolls Royce; inserting ATTLE[E] into the two Rs gives you your answer.  Lovely story-telling surface.
"
3342,Altogether enthusiastic about story with no ending,IN TOTAL,"Definition: Altogether
A charade of INTO and TAL[E].  ‘He’s really enthusiastic about/into football.’
"
3343,Really big night – heart rate’s racing,EARTHSHATTERING,"Definition: Really big
anagram of NIGHT HEART RATE’S; with ‘racing’ as the anagrind.  I would always write this with a hyphen, but dictionaries will no doubt say otherwise.
"
3344,"Catch with line at sea, as per strict rules",TECHNICAL,"Definition: as per strict rules
Bit of a strange definition for TECHNICAL, but it’s anagram of CATCH LINE; with ‘at sea’ as the anagrind.
"
3345,Cat perhaps catching small crow,BOAST,"Definition: crow
Another really clever, but misleading, surface.  The ‘cat’ is a catamaran, or BOAT; stick S for small in that and you’ve got a verb meaning ‘to crow’.
"
3346,Gather tea while cycling,AMASS,"Definition: Gather
ASSAM is the tea; you need to ‘cycle’ the last two letters to the front.  Some folk don’t like this device, but I think it’s fine.
"
3347,It’s traditional to tear a strip off bully,ROAST BEEF,"Definition: It’s traditional
A charade of ROAST for ‘tear a strip off’ and BEEF for BULLY BEEF, a staple of army food for many years – just CORNED BEEF.  The BULLY apparently came from the French *bouilli*, meaning ‘boiled’.
"
3348,"Finally, encouragingly, late on in crisis recession essentially bottoms out",LAST BUT NOT LEAST,"Definition: Finally, encouragingly
I have stared at this long enough.  I have absolutely no idea how this works, so will throw this one open to the audience.  I thank you in advance.
"
3349,Source of one blow after another for followers,FAN CLUB,"Definition: followers
Morph has written some cracking surfaces in this crossword.  The two sources of ‘blows’ are a FAN and a CLUB.
"
3350,"Cricketer finally dismissed, third to last, one that’s an important part of Indian order",BASMATI,"Definition: that’s an important part of Indian order
What was I just saying?  A bit trickier to parse: it’s BATSMA[N], with the third letter T moved to last, plus I.
"
3351,Spy under pressure returned pieces of silver,DESSERTSPOONS,"Definition:  pieces of silver
A reversal of SNOOP and STRESSED.  I was going to say this was a brilliant clue as well, but I don’t want the setter getting ideas above his station as a harmless drudge.  Actually, it was very cleverly constructed – bravo.
"
3352,Exaggerated fear confused with real thing by left,LARGER THAN LIFE,"Definition: Exaggerated
A charade of L for ‘left’ and anagram of FEAR REAL THING;
"
3353,Total state,UTTER,"Definition: Totalstate
A slightly worn at the edges dd.
"
3354,What two partners do in bridge with two hearts in play?,HOLD HANDS,"Definition: What two partners do in bridgetwo hearts in play
A much better dd.
"
3355,A quarter of eleven or thirteen,NORTH,"Definition: A quarter
Cleverly hidden in eleveN OR THirteen.
"
3356, Trace where takings are put – in special account,SCINTILLA,"Definition:  Trace
An insertion of IN TILL in S for ‘special’ and CA for ‘current account’.  We had this discussion a while ago – it might even have been a Morph puzzle – where CA for ‘account’ was questioned, but it is in dictionaries.  AC is more common, though.
"
3357,Unreserved about being flamboyant,OUTR,"Definition: flamboyant
ÉA charade of OUT and RE.
"
3358,Celebrities getting out?  One joining in for possible means of going to ground,FLIGHT OF STAIRS,"Definition: possible means of going to ground
An insertion of I for ‘one’ in FLIGHT OF STARS, which is what slebs would do if they wanted to avoid publicity.  As if.
"
3359,Made rude joke about Wenger,COARSENED,"Definition: Made rude
Those that didn’t like 7dn will like this even less, since while no football knowledge was required in that clue, here you have to know that Arsène Wenger is Arsenal’s manager.  For the minute, at least.  So it’s an insertion of ARSENE in COD.  To begin with, as Arsène is wont to say, ‘I deedn’t see eet’.
"
3360,Diamonds that can be transported outside – you’ll find some on this,CARD TABLE,"Definition: this
Another insertion: of D for ‘diamonds’ in CARTABLE for an unlikely but real word for ‘can be transported’.  Card Games 2-2 Footie.  An honourable draw.
"
3361,Replaces contents of bar – Courage Best?,BOTTLES UP,"Definition: Replaces contents of bar
Well, my best stab at this is that it’s BOTTLE’S UP.  BOTTLE is a slang word for courage, and if ‘courage is best’ then ‘courage is up’.  But someone may have a better idea.
"
3362,Fat controllers perhaps putting energy into sandwiches,BELTS,"Definition: Fat controllers perhaps
Another smile.  An insertion of E into BLTS for Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato sandwiches.  Sir Topham Hatt, the Fat Controller in *Thomas the Tank Engine*, was allegedly in charge of the railway, except those engines just kept being soooo naughty.
"
3363,Sun’s circulation perhaps inflated – cut margins by 50%,ORBIT,"Definition: Sun’s circulation
With a little help from a friend, I can tell you that this is [EX]ORBIT[ANT].  I’m not saying this clue is unfair: once you’ve got the crossing letters it’s pretty obvious; but the construction is a bit left-field.
"
3364,All the rage of French retreat in battle,ALAMO,"Definition: battle
A LA MO[DE].  DE is one of the French words for ‘of’ and Morph is asking you to remove that to end up with the famous American battle.  ‘Retreat’ as a removal indicator might raise eyebrows, but since this was a delightful crossword, I for one am prepared to be indulgent.
"
3365,"Stock up, maybe, with hard confectionery",TUCKSHOP,"Definition: confectionery
anagram of STOCK UP H;  I didn’t have the dubious privilege of going to a public school; but for me, a TUCKSHOP is where posh kids went to buy confectionery, rather than the confectionery itself.  Some posh kid can no doubt put me right.
"
3366,Erase scratch,DELETE,"Definition: Erasescratch
It’s a dd, but neither it nor the surface is very convincing.
"
3367,University given commendation and put in top place,UPRAISED,"Definition: put in top place
A charade of U and PRAISED.
"
3368,Son to analyse words in a sentence that are few and far between,SPARSE,"Definition: few and far between

A charade of KNUCKLE and HEAD.
"

3372,Broadcast for a trifling amount,PROGRAMME,"Definition: Broadcast
A charade of PRO for ‘for’ and GRAMME for ‘a trifling amount’.  More commonly spelt GRAM, but both versions are in dictionaries.
"
3373,Bird the French gave a name to,TITLE,"Definition: gave a name to
Well, it’s TIT for ‘bird’ and LE for one of the words in French for ‘the’.  But surely the cryptic grammar is wrong here?  The solution should be TITLED, or ‘gave’ should be ‘give’.  Otherwise it doesn’t work, does it?
"
3374,VAT tax anger perhaps exceeding reasonable bounds,EXTRAVAGANT,"Definition: exceeding reasonable bounds
anagram of VAT TAX ANGER;
"
3375,"Slinky five in sleet, dancing!",SVELTE,"Definition: Slinky

Another insertion, of NO and M in MISER.
"
3377,"The Spanish, consumed by misplaced envy for the diarist",EVELYN,"Definition: diarist
And another insertion: of EL for one of the words in Spanish for ‘the’ in anagram of ENVY;  It’s referring to John Evelyn (1620–1706), the diarist.  No, I’d never heard of him either.
"
3378,Not put on the spot and not in the frame,UNPLACED,"Definition: Not put on the spotnot in the frame
Another not very convincing dd.  Is one of the definitions referring to snooker?
"
3379,Dealing with up and coming locations in service stations,TRUCK STOPS,"Definition: service stations
A charade of TRUCK for ‘dealing’ (‘I will have no truck with him’) and a reversal of SPOTS.  ‘Up and coming’ works as the reversal indicator because it’s a down clue.
"
3380,Dishonesty? Rot!,CORRUPTION,"Definition: DishonestyRot
Another dd.
"
3381,Perhaps risk Frenchman intruding with a smug smile,SMIRK,"Definition: smug smile

ANNU[A]L
"
3391,"This one’s sceptred, according to Shakespeare",ISLE,"Definition: This one’s sceptred

"
3392,There are some ditherers in this place!,HERE,"Definition:  in this place
Hidden in ditHERErs.
"
3393,"Greek character, say, heading off to change",MUTATE,"Definition: to change

A reversal of LIAM for your archetypal Irishman and ORDER for ‘book’.
"
3404,"Had nice spread, a ranch",HACIENDA,"Definition: ranch
anagram of HAD NICE; plus A.  ‘Spread’ is the anagrind.  A HACIENDA is strictly an ‘estate’, but it could be used for ranching, so the clue is fair enough.
"
3405,A small seabird behind,ASTERN,"Definition: behind
A charade of A, S and TERN.  Might have seen this one before.
"
3406,Held in stomach is mostly a show of masculinity,MACHISMO,"Definition: a show of masculinity

A charade of TRIAL for ‘test’ and RUN for the ladder ladies get in their tights
"
3416,Type of egg dish,SCOTCH,"Definition: Type of egg dish
Unless I’m missing something, this just seems to be a rather weak cd.  Happy to be corrected.
"
3417,Cut? Clean wound,LANCE,"Definition: Cut
anagram of CLEAN;  To make the anagrind work, I think you’d have to pronounce it as the past tense of WIND, rather than what you’d incur in battle.
"
3418,Departs in military aircraft erks initially fly,MIDGE,"Definition: fly
Another cleverly-constructed surface.  An insertion of D in MIG (fighter aircraft) followed by E for the first letter of Erks.  Erk is a word: it means an aircraftsman of the lowest rank and will be coming to a puzzle near you soon when the setter doesn’t fancy moose.
"
3419,Lawyer detained by short hearing maybe carried chairs,SEDANS,"Definition: carried chairs
An insertion of DA or District Attorney, the American term for ‘lawyer’ in SENS[E].  Hearing is one of the senses, hence the ‘maybe’.
"
3420,Duplicitous women belonging to American church interrupting Irish politician,TWO,"Definition: Duplicitous
-FACEDAlchemi seems keen on long clues and convoluted wordplay.  This is perfectly fair: it’s an insertion of W for ‘women’ and OF A CE for ‘belonging to American church’ in TD for the abbreviation for ‘Irish Politician’.  Teachta Dála, usually abbreviated to TD, is a member of Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament.
"
3421,About to stop mother’s fantasies,DREAMS,"Definition: fantasies
An insertion of RE for ‘about’ in DAMS for ‘mothers’.  Don’t forget to ignore the apostrophe.
"
3422,Major road allows for travellers,MIGRANTS,"Definition: travellers
A charade of MI for ‘M1’, which is certainly a major road if you live oop north, and GRANTS.
"
3423,Company functions in public transport,BUSINESS,"Definition: Company
An insertion of SINES in BUS.  SINES are mathematical functions.  It’s the opposite over the hypotenuse, if I remember well.  Which I may not have done.
"
3424,"Healthy, Queen Paul?",WELLER,"Definition: Paul
A charade of WELL and ER for Her Maj, or Brenda according to *Private Eye*.  Alchemi is taking us back to the 80s, with Paul WELLER as the reference.

"
3426,Back into crash point set up in advance,PREARRANGE,"Definition: set up in advance
An example of a surface without much meaning: it’s an insertion of REAR for ‘back’ in PRANG for ‘crash’ followed by E for one of the ‘points’ of the compass.
"
3427,Service brought to a premature end with financial centre’s involvement in conspiracy,COMPLICITY,"Definition: involvement in conspiracy
My best stab at this is COMPLI[NE] for a shortened ‘service’ and CITY, but that is no doubt balls and someone will parse it properly for us.
"
3428,Boast about noise,CROW,"Definition: Boast
A charade of C for circa or ‘about’ and ROW for ‘noise’.
"
3429,Corrects what an author does over the phone,RIGHTS,"Definition: Corrects

"
3430,"Replacing disc with electronic memory, showbiz mogul becomes dictator",CROMWELL,"Definition: dictator
Alchemi is asking you to take the O out of C[O]WELL and replace it with ROM.  O is a ‘disc’; ROM is read only ‘memory’ in a computer; and Simon COWELL is some trumped-up television personality, apparently.  Was CROMWELL a ‘dictator’?  Discuss.
"
3431,Starts in appalling situation after carrion runs riot without right instruments,OCARINAS,"Definition: instruments
I like surfaces to tell me a story or to put a picture in my head.  This one did neither – what is this all about?  It’s a charade of anagram of CA[R]RION; plus AS for the first letters of Appalling Situation.  The anagrind is ‘runs riot’ and ‘without right’ is the removal indicator.
"
3432,Haile Selassie once lost rat on hunting trip,SAFARI,"Definition: hunting trip
I missed this clue out of the original blog.  Michelle has explained it below.
"
3433,"Become pessimistic, having left crucial beer ingredient in old bishopric",LOSE HOPE,"Definition: Become pessimistic

"
3434,Ship’s engineer initially having trouble with German sailor,SEA DOG,"Definition: sailor
This *was* a good, story-telling surface.  SE for the first letters of ‘ship’s engineer’ followed by ADO and G.
"
3435,Explanatory panel deconstructing air beds,SIDEBAR,"Definition: Explanatory panel
I knew it had to be anagram of AIR BEDS; but I couldn’t see it for a while.  A SIDEBAR is a boxed article in a newspaper, placed alongside the main article and containing supplementary material.  I never knew that.
"
3436,Physician every so often gets crowd to take his advice in winter?,DRESS WARM,"Definition: to take his advice in winter
I can’t parse this either, I’m afraid.  My best guess is that it’s a charade of DR, ES and SWARM, but where the ES bit comes from I can’t fathom.  They are the first letters of Every and So, but how the clue tells us that is beyond me.  *Edit: as others have kindly pointed out, ES comes from the even letters of gEtS.  How could I not see that?*
"
3437,"Calling Campbell, say, to support new head of astrophysics",NAMING,"Definition: Calling
The world of politics: not Alastair, but Menzies, commonly known as MING Campbell.  So since it’s a down clue, it’s N plus A for the first letter of Astrophysics followed by MING.
"
3438,Jokes about horse getting the smallest bit imaginable,WHIT,"Definition: the smallest bit imaginable
An insertion of H for ‘horse’ or heroin in WIT.

3440,Grand Union perhaps may bring adversarial sides together,CANAL,"Definition: Grand Union perhaps

A charade of DE for the French word for ‘of’ and SERVE.
"
3442,Works key player to the end of the day,FACTORY,"Definition: Works

anagram of FI[R]STHALF;
"
3445,Author‘s list of vehicles,CARROLL,"Definition: Author list of vehicles
A dd cum cd.  I might have fancied a question mark at the end of this clue, since it’s whimsical.  A list of vehicles might be a CAR ROLL, and it’s referring to Lewis CARROLL, aka Charles Dodgson, best known perhaps for *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland*.
"
3446,Coming to final conclusion in what toddlers have to learn?,WALKING,"Definition: Coming to final conclusionwhat toddlers have to learn
A dd, I fancy.  My SOED under definition 7 says ‘(*slang*), die’, so I think it must be that.  *Edit: Michelle explains this for us at comment number 2; thank you to her.*
"
3447,Ian McKellen starts with insipid run through,IMPALE,"Definition: run through

A charade of WAS and P for ‘piano’ or ‘soft’.  An acronym for White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.  Elite?  Now that Obama is President, perhaps not, but it’s still a well-used phrase.
"
3450,Girl returns with duke after working in American field,DIAMOND,"Definition: American field
A charade of DIAM for MAID reversed, ON for ‘working’ and D for ‘duke’.  It’s referring to the diamond in a baseball field.  Cissy’s game.

3451,Spies arrest cook leaving southern republic,CROATIA,"Definition: republic
Kairos is asking you to take the S out of ROA[S]T and surround it by the CIA.
"
3452,Job description written by trendy hospital visitor,INPATIENT,"Definition: hospital visitor
Lovely misleading surface.  ‘Job description’ here is nothing to do with Human Resource Departments: it’s referring to the Biblical Job, who was renowned for his patience.  So it’s a charade of IN and PATIENT.
"
3453,Baby boy gets everything,TOTAL,"Definition: everything
A charade of TOT and AL for ‘boy’.
"
3454,Met over a drink,DECAF,"Definition: a drink

A N CHO[I]RMAN.
"
3456,Put in charge of various nutters,ENTRUST,"Definition: Put in charge of
anagram of NUTTERS;
"
3457,Physical state of work included in note,ENTROPY,"Definition: Physical state
This is a word I did know, having studied sciences a long time ago, but it’s probably not a term that’s passed into public consciousness.  I remember it as being to do with the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the concept of irreversibility: entropy cannot decrease.  Defining entropy in two words is a brave move.  If memory serves, Dormouse is our resident physicist, so if he or another scientist of that persuasion drops in, he can tell you whether it’s fair.
"
3458,Extremely half-hearted friend hides sweet,ACUTELY,"Definition: Extremely
Another insertion, of CUTE in A[L]LY, or AL[L]Y, take your pick.
"
3459, Ban broadcast about marketing feature,SUSPEND,"Definition:  Ban
And another insertion: of USP in SEND.  USP is a marketing acronym for Unique Selling Point: what makes your mousetrap better than everyone else’s.
"
3460,Spooner’s people quickly become deadpan,POKER FACE,"Definition: deadpan
I’m not a big fan of the Reverend’s clues, but this one is a Spoonerism of FOLK APACE.
"
3461,Smash ball for a point,PRONG,"Definition: point
No doubt a dd, but for the life of me I can’t see or discover why.  *Edit: Muffyword has kindly explained this one.  PRANG is a crash and if you replace the A with an O (ball?) you get PRONG.*
"
3462,Poet’s description of emptiness is elliptical,OVOID,"Definition: elliptical
Another insertion, of O in OVID.  Is O for ’emptiness’ acceptable?  You decide.
"
3463,Remove arresting officer for wearing a low-cut dress!,D,"Definition: a low-cut dress
ÉCOLLETÉThis setter likes insertions, although you’ve got to say the surface is a good’un.  The indicator here is ‘arresting’ and it’s COL in DELETE, for the French term we’ve pinched into English for the type of dress where there’s a bit of cleavage on show.

A charade of OU for ‘Open University’, TOFT for ‘historical home’ and UNE for one of the French words for ‘a’.  For ‘toft’, my SOED gives ‘a homestead, the site of a house and its outbuildings’.  It also marks it as late middle English, which I guess is where the ‘historical’ bit is coming from.

-CASTanagram of CADETS I;
"
3470,Audible reminder to stimulate skin,CUTICLE,"Definition: skin
A homophone (‘audible’) of CUE TICKLE.  I’d always had CUTICLE down as the half-moon thing at the base of your nails (which it is); but it’s also a synonym for the epidermis, so fair play.

An insertion of P-PRO in AVE.  You have to know two things here: that AVE is a Latin greeting meaning Hail! (think AVE MARIA); and that TOM is a slang word for a prostitute, as is PRO.  Luckily I did know these two things, but it still took me an age to see what was going on.

3533,Plot involving a shop attendant,SATELLITE,"Definition: attendant
It’s an insertion of A TELL in SITE, as far as I can see.  I wasn’t familiar with this ‘attendant’ definition, but it’s the first entry in my SOED: ‘A member of an important person’s staff or retinue; a follower, an underling.’   TELL for ‘shop’ I can’t really reconcile.  If you ‘shop’ someone, you turn them in or TELL ON them, but that’s not the same as TELL, is it?

An insertion of LUCI[N]DA in ÉTÉ, the French word for ‘summer’.  *Été* seems to come up in clues quite often, and I sometimes raise an eyebrow about what your average solver is expected to know in terms of French words.  LE, LA, LES, DE … for sure.  But I’m not certain that *été* would be high up on the list of everyone’s schoolboy or schoolgirl French.  No-one’s ever commented on it, so perhaps I’m wrong.  To give you a clue, there’s the English word aestival, derived from the same Latin root and meaning ‘related to summer’, but that’s perhaps not in everyone’s passive vocabulary either.

"
3845,"Grave words, essentially well-meaning, about father putting on weight",EPITAPH,"Definition: Grave words
If you parsed this effortlessly, then bravo, because I had to phone a friend.  Who had to go away and think about it.  Like an investigative journalist, I can’t reveal my sources, but the young lady in question says that it’s E for the central letter (‘essentially’) of well-mEaning, followed by an insertion of AP, which is PA (‘father’) reversed in PITH, for which definition number three in Collins says ‘weight’.  The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse would have been galloping into my front garden by the time I’d parsed that.
"
3846,Best to follow with piping hot cooked food,WHIPPING CREAM,"Definition: food
‘Best’ is CREAM, as in ‘cream of the crop’.  Poins is asking you to put WHIPPING before this, which is anagram of W PIPING H; with ‘cooked’ as the anagrind.  WHIPPING CREAM is food in the sense that you can eat it, so the clue is fair; but I would more likely describe it as an ingredient.
"
3847,"Denis, seconds away, failed to stop when uncertain",INDETERMINATE,"Definition: uncertain
If you take S for ‘seconds’ away from DENI[S], then make an anagram to get INDE (the anagrind is ‘failed’) then add TERMINATE for ‘stop’, then you’ve got your answer.
"
3848,State categorically – this eventually follows when a girl’s on speed,ASSEVERATE,"Definition: State categorically
Another word that I wouldn’t count as being high on the list in my passive vocabulary.  Sounds a bit too posh to me.  It’s a charade of AS for ‘when’, S for the last letter of thiS, EVE for ‘girl’ and RATE for ‘speed’.  I am going to need a lie-down soon.

"
3852, Illingworth had a short one to manage getting out of bed,RUN,"Definition:  Illingworth had a short one
-UPAnother fairly random cricket reference.  Raymond Illingworth was a slow right-arm spinner from Yorkshire who played for England between 1958 and 1973 and went on to become a selector.  Since he was a slow bowler, he had a short RUN-UP.  It’s RUN for ‘manage’ and UP for ‘out of bed’.

The coalition government has been a boon to setters, putting VINCE CABLE, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills into the realms of being well-known enough to include in clues.  It’s [C]ABLE, and I agree with Poins: he is a talented minister, who has an intellect and isn’t afraid to use it.

An insertion of HE for ‘man’, A N for ‘a Nationalist’ in anagram of YES A MUSE;  ‘Somehow’ is the anagrind and ‘inspired’ (breathed in) is the inclusion indicator.  Seamus Heaney was born in Northern Ireland but spent much of his life in Dublin, so I am going to describe this as an &lit clue.  And a clever one.

anagram of TEMPLE;
"
3869,Pilgrimage site not to be considered?  Excellent!,KNOCKOUT,"Definition: Excellent

"
3872,Tree in which an MP urinates perhaps,SUMATRAN PINE,"Definition: Tree
anagram of AN MP URINATES; Not the best-known tree on earth (this is an eimi puzzle) but PINE looked likely for the four-letter part of the clue and the rest made sense from the anagram fodder and a couple of crossers.  MPs have committed myriad transgressions, but weeing from a tree is not one of them.  Yet.
"
3873,City equally good in warmth of feeling,GLASGOW,"Definition: City
An insertion of AS G for ‘equally good’ in GLOW.

Hidden in clEAR A CHEque.
"
3876,"Breaking golden rule, not starting with university drop-out registered",ENROLLED,"Definition: registered

"
3879,Abscond from somewhere in the Middle East,LEVANT,"Definition: Abscondsomewhere in the Middle East
Collins has taken a hammering this morning:  ‘levant: to bolt or abscond, esp to avoid paying debts’.  And with its capital letter, the LEVANT is a word for parts of the Middle East.  Comes from the present participle of the French verb *lever*, meaning ‘rising’, since the sun rises in the East.  I never knew that.  But as is usual with an eimi puzzle, I normally know more when I’ve finished than when I started.  Thanks to him for today’s thoughtful offering.

According to his profile, Nitsy is a primary school teacher, so getting in a dig in the first clue at the muppet who is Secretary of State for Education is an excellent achievement, and I hereby award him a gold star.  A charade of P, O for the first letter of ‘Ofsted’ and MP.  For overseas solvers, Ofsted is the Office for Standards In Education and is the teacher’s best friend.  Not.

"
4015,Abstemious muse mostly found in poetical beauty spot,TEMPERATE,"Definition: Abstemious
An insertion of ERAT[O] in TEMPE.  ERATO was one of the nine Muses, and daughter of Zeus (no swans involved this time).   The picturesque vale of TEMPE is in modern Greece.  TEMPE was in ancient times celebrated by Greek poets as a favourite haunt of Apollo and The Muses.  So there you go.  Random factoid: ‘abstemious’ is one of only two common English words to have all five vowels once only in alphabetical order; the other is ‘facetious’.
"
4016,"Not exactly you to hold Rex, a boy, as an object of veneration",OUR LADY,"Definition: an object of veneration
An insertion of R LAD in anagram of YOU;.  R for ‘Rex’ in its ‘king’ sense.  OUR LADY, the Blessed Virgin Mary and Jesus’ mother, is particularly venerated in the Catholic tradition.  Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris is named after her.
"
4017,A subordinate keeping son apart,ASUNDER,"Definition: apart
An insertion of S in A UNDER.
"
4018,Writing up story about Conservative’s social distinction,,"Definition: social distinction
ÉCLATI’m more used to this word meaning ‘radiance’ or ‘brilliance’, but ‘social distinction’ is indeed definition number three in my SOED.  An insertion of C in TALE reversed.  ‘Writing up’ is the reversal indicator because it’s a down clue.
"
4019,Topless just as before,ERE,"Definition: before
[M]ERE gives you the mainly poetic word for ‘before’.  But I’m not convinced that the clue works, since you can’t really substitute ‘just’ for ‘mere’; it would have to be ‘merely’.
"
4020,Lead and gold material that will transmit electricity,CONDUCTOR,"Definition: material that will transmit electricity
A charade of CONDUCT for ‘lead’ and OR for ‘gold’.
"
4021,Mother trimmed outfit worn by soldier on leave,MUFTI,"Definition: worn by soldier on leave
It’s clever, but what ‘beginners and those in a hurry’ will make of it, I’m not sure. It’s MU[M], which is ‘mother trimmed’ and FTI, which is an anagram of anagram of FIT;  The anagrind is ‘out’, which is attached to FIT in the surface.  Hmmm.
"
4022,Worried our town appears behind the times,OUTWORN,"Definition: behind the times
anagram of OUR TOWN; with ‘worried’ as the anagrind.
"
4023,Evidence links nothing to artist at Italian address,SIGNORA,"Definition: Italian address

anagram of NOTES A TIME; with ‘to move’ as the anagrind.
"
4026,To be liberal with butter at first appears healthy,FAT,"Definition: healthy
-FREEWell, the cryptic grammar seems all over the place to me, but it’s FAT for ‘butter’ followed by FREE for ‘to be liberal’.  ‘Butter, for example’ might define FAT better.
"
4027,"Transport by rail perhaps, if time",AIRLIFT,"Definition: Transport
A charade of anagram of RAIL; IF and T for ‘time’
"
4028,Good to respect expert,HONOURABLE,"Definition: Good
A charade of HONOUR and ABLE.  Except (for me at least) being ABLE doesn’t mean I’m ‘expert’ at something.  I’m able at cryptics, for example, but …
"
4029,Make an impression and so on at hospital,ETCH,"Definition: Make an impression
A charade of ETC and H.
"
4030,Circle missing outlines with cooking implement,UTENSIL,"Definition: implement
The surface is not putting a picture in my head and it’s too complicated for a Quiptic anagram of imho).  The setter is asking you to take O for ‘circle’ out of (‘missing’) ‘outlines’ and make an anagram (‘with cooking’).  So it’s ([O]UTLINES;
"
4031,Set dance disrupted by English student,CONGEAL,"Definition: Set
An insertion of E in CONGA followed by L for learner or ‘student’.
"
4032,Five tucked into healthy share,HALVE,"Definition: share
Another insertion of V for the Roman numeral for ‘five’ in HALE for ‘healthy’.  As in ‘hale and hearty’.  And it would only be a ‘share’ if it was between two.
"
4033,Can well recall engineers being doubtful at cut,RETENTIVE,"Definition: Can well recall
I refer right honourable members to my comment at 24ac.  RE for ‘engineers’ followed by TENT[AT]IVE.
"
4034,Where philosophers are trained?,SCHOOL OF THOUGHT,"Definition: Where philosophers are trained
A cd.
"
4035,Original sin can act without a gut feeling,INSTINCT,"Definition: gut feeling
Is this too complicated for a Quiptic?  You tell me.  It’s anagram of SIN;, TIN and [A]CT.  The anagrind is ‘original’ and the surface is pretty meaningless.
"
4036,Coach tour has altered boarding time,TUTOR,"Definition: Coach
An insertion of T for ‘time’ inside anagram of ‘boarding’) (TOUR;
"
4037,Old-fashioned to plant herb without style,STONE AGE,"Definition: Old-fashioned
An insertion of TONE for ‘style’ in SAGE for ‘herb’.  The insertion indicator is ‘to plant without’.  I think.
"
4038,Unsalted crab is late addition to snacks,CRISPS,"Definition: snacks
I wanted to preface my explanation of this clue with a three-letter acronym, the first two of which are the the sixth letter of the alphabet; but the site administrator would strike me off the list of bloggers if I did, so I won’t.  If you are a beginner or improver, well done if you understood this, because it took me ages to solve it and parse it.  AB is ‘able bodied seaman’; another synonym for ‘seaman’ is ‘salt’; take AB out of ‘crab’ (‘unsalted’) and you’ve got CR; add IS; then add PS for *post scriptum* or ‘late addition’ and you’ve got CRISPS.  Which are snacks.
"
4039,Pretend I am angry with one suspect,IMAGINARY,"Definition: Pretend
A charade of I’M for ‘I am’ and anagram of ANGRY I;  ‘Suspect’ is the anagrind.
"
4040,Attempt to elevate iron building,EFFORT,"Definition: Attempt
Since this is a down clue, it’s a reversal of FE for ‘iron’ and FORT for ‘building’.
"
4041,Twist of her logic treated as support for smokers,CIGARETTE HOLDER,"Definition: support for smokers
anagram of HER LOGIC TREATED;
"
4042,Con man misrepresented Freud’s art,FRAUDSTER,"Definition: Con man
anagram of FREUDS ART;
"
4043,Assign place to a student,ALLOCATE,"Definition: Assign
A charade of A plus L for learner or ‘student’ and LOCATE for ‘place’.  But the ‘to’ in the clue doesn’t tell you which way round to put the parts of the charade.
"
4044, Brave of one to get books about rising depression,INTREPID,"Definition:  Brave
A four-part charade: I plus NT for ‘books’ of the bible plus RE for ‘about’ plus PID for a reversal of DIP for ‘depression’.
"
4045,Irritate with unnecessary loss of two points,NEEDLE,"Definition: Irritate
NEEDLE[SS]  The ‘two points’ are SS for two lots of ‘south’ for points of the compass.
"
4046,Everyone united regarding appeal,ALLURE,"Definition: appeal

anagram of ANNE I;  The anagrind is ‘to get involved with’.
"
4048,"Controversially teach warmth of colour, including, essentially, the work of 19 down",THE CAT IN THE HAT,"Definition: work of 19 down
Bit of a convoluted clue to get us going, which I got with a few crossers from the enumeration.  It’s a charade of anagram of TEACH; followed by an insertion of H for ‘the, essentially’ in TINT HEAT.  The anagrind is ‘controversially’, the insertion indicator is ‘including’, and the surface is pretty meaningless.  Once you’ve got this, then 19dn is a write-in.  The book is perhaps the best known work of Theodor Seuss Geisel, who made important contributions to the promotion of literacy in the USA.
"
4049,Sound crowd to keep in reserve,HOARD,"Definition: to keep in reserve
A homophone of HORDE.
"
4050,Vandal missing a line crashes coach taking Andy Murray to Wimbledon,IVAN LENDL,"Definition: coach taking Andy Murray to Wimbledon
Alchemi is inviting you to remove the A from V[A]NDAL and then make an anagram: anagram of VNDAL LINE;  Lendl became Murray’s coach a while ago and is credited with helping the Scot to become one of the outstanding players on the men’s circuit.
"
4051,Church artist with power and guts,VISCERA,"Definition: guts
You need to remember that VIS is the Latin word for ‘strength, power’, then the more common CE and RA for ‘church’ and ‘artist’.  However, the clue could equally lead to CERAVIS (which isn’t a word, I know).
"
4052,Rock a German showed Saddam?,HUSSEIN,"Definition: Saddam
HUSS, I discovered, is another word for the rock salmon, and of course EIN is one of the German words for ‘a’.  My SOED does give ‘rock’ as a shortened version of ‘rock salmon’, so the clue is fair; but I probably wouldn’t go into my fishmonger’s and ask for ‘two rocks, please’.
"
4053,Very unfavourable climate for over-the-hill sexual practice,STORM,"Definition: Very unfavourable climate
An insertion of TOR for ‘hill’ in S (and) M for sadomasochism.  STORM is weather, not climate, as readers in the south of England will be discovering around now.  The title track for this clue is *Hit Me Baby One More Time.*

A charade of EN for ‘enrolled nurse’ and GROSSED.

"
4060,Westminster district Liberals drink heavily,SWILL,"Definition: drink heavily
You would need to know – or guess – that the postcode SW1 covers the Westminster area of London.  Add two Ls to that and you’ve got your answer.
"
4061,Clergyman taking drug is back before film of French actress,SIMONE SIGNORET,"Definition: French actress
Her name was vaguely familiar – I’m not a film buff – but it took all the crossing letters before I could have a stab at it.  I parsed it (finally) as an insertion of E for ‘drug’ in MONSIGNOR for ‘clergyman’ preceded (‘before’) by SI for ‘is back’ and followed by ET for ‘film’.  What the ‘of’ in the surface is doing I’m not sure.
"
4062,Memorial to the sound of Dr Arnold’s voice?,HEADSTONE,"Definition: Memorial
Thomas Arnold was one-time head of Rugby School.  The sound of his voice would therefore be HEAD’S TONE.
"
4063,America dreads harbouring revolutionary cell,CADRE,"Definition: revolutionary cell
Hidden in AmeriCA DREads.
"
4064,Asian Spooner’s joints less sunburned?,TAIWANESE,"Definition: Asian
Well, I think this is meant to be a Spoonerism of WHITER KNEES.  If it is, I’ll rest my case that Spoonerisms are my least favourite type of clue.  Just me.
"
4065,Welsh rugby club has a cow on the goalpost,NEATH,"Definition: Welsh rugby club
In 27ac, we had NEAT in its best-known sense.  Here it’s in its ‘cattle’ sense, so it’s a charade of NEAT and H for rugby ‘goalpost’.  Why? Because rugby goalposts are in the shape of an H.  Which is why I might have fancied ‘goalposts’ in the clue rather than ‘goalpost’.
"
4066,I’m surprised at sign of election result,HOLY SMOKE,"Definition: I’m surprisedsign of election result
A dd.  A perhaps rather old-fashioned exclamation is what comes out of the Vatican chimney when a new Pope has been elected.  When it’s white, of course.
"
4067,Chicken goes to church from here,HENCE,"Definition: from here
A charade of HEN and CE.
"

"
4070,Scrum turned over regularly at social supported by heavyweight cook,MRS BEETON,"Definition: cook
It’s not a great story-telling surface, is it?  The odd letters of ‘scrum’ reversed give you MRS; BEE is a word for ‘a social gathering’ and TON is a heavy weight.  Cook she certainly was, but *Mrs Beeton’s Book of Household Management* was much more a guide to running a middle-class Victorian household.  First, catch your hare … except that the phrase had been in existence for at least 100 years before she wrote the book.  She died young, at 28.
"
4071,Publisher has some work after reversing glitch with internal communications system,GUTENBERG,"Definition: Publisher
The ERG is a unit of work, so roughly ‘some work’.  Put that at the end of GUTENB, which is an insertion of NET for ‘communications system’ in BUG for ‘glitch’ reversed, and you’ve got the German inventor of the printing press.
"
4072,Place a giveaway sign in dependent community,SATELLITE,"Definition: dependent community
An insertion of A TELL in SITE.  I was struggling to understand TELL as ‘giveaway sign’, in other words a noun.  But my SOED has: ‘tell: a talk, a conversation, a gossip’.  But it marks it as ‘Scottish, or dialect’, so perhaps not ideal for a weekday cryptic.
"
4073,Writer takes action against street rising to the south,DR SEUSS,"Definition: Writer
A reversal of SUES RD followed by S for ‘south’.  SUE for the second time in the same crossword.
"
4074,Optimistically announced East End cuppa,ROSILY,"Definition: Optimistically
I don’t want to start a homophone-or-not debate that will drag on for the rest of the day, but no way does ROSIE LEE (Cockney rhyming slang for ‘tea’) sound the same as ROSILY.  And even if it did, the clue is ambiguous as to whether the answer is one or the other (and yes, I know it can only be one because it’s a six-letter word).
"
4075,Eccentric man in London suburb,CHEAM,"Definition: London suburb
An insertion of HE in CAM.  ‘Cam: a slider or roller attached to a rotating shaft to give a particular type of reciprocating motion’ (Collins).  Hence ‘eccentric’.  I think.

"
4077,Enthusiasm for tailing theatre cat,GUSTO,"Definition: Enthusiasm

TWEE[T]

4079,"Heath Robinson, say, showing duck in box – it’s Daffy?",CARTOONIST,"Definition: Heath Robinson, say
An insertion of O for ‘duck’ anagram of in cricket) in CARTON, followed by (ITS;  ‘Daffy’ is the anagrind, although of course he’s also a duck.  Heath Robinson was the cartoonist best known for his depictions of unlikely inventions, and his name is used nowadays to describe some apparatus or equipment that’s been cobbled together.
"
4080,"Rectangular harpsichord, spotless",VIRGINAL,"Definition: Rectangular harpsichordspotless
Well, it had to be that; but I needed Tinternet to confirm that a VIRGINAL is indeed a ‘rectangular harpsichord’.  So it’s a dd.
"
4081,"Exhausted, American editor on horseback",USED,"Definition: Exhausted
-UPA charade of US, ED, and UP for ‘on horseback’.
"
4082,Envisage article making one fume,SEETHE,"Definition: fume
A charade of SEE and THE.
"
4083,Transport access,ENTRANCE,"Definition: Transportaccess
A dd.  If you haven’t seen it before (and it has been round the block a bit) then for the first definition put the stress on the second syllable, and for the second definition put it on the first.  One’s a noun; the other’s a verb.
"
4084,"Headcase with broken finger, leaves group of extremists",LUNATIC FRINGE,"Definition: group of extremists

4089,"Neglected child runs through Battersea, distressed",STREET ARAB,"Definition: Neglected child
Everyman is asking you to insert R into BATTERSEA and then make an anagram anagram of ‘distressed’).  I’d never heard this phrase, but STREET was fairly obvious and (ABRA; can’t be much else.
"
4090,Drawn on match day,TIED,"Definition: Drawn 
A charade of TIE and D for ‘day’.
"
4091,Female trapping number in lift,HEIGHTEN,"Definition: lift
An insertion of EIGHT in HEN.  Think hen nights.  Or maybe not.
"
4092,Image I study,ICON,"Definition: Image
A charade of I and CON for ‘study’, which definition you only ever see in cryptics these days.  ICON is indeed strictly a ‘religious image’, but the battle to keep it as just that has long been lost, I fancy.
"
4093,Valuable wood from this place?  Better off spending capital,LOCUST TREE,"Definition: Valuable wood
A charade of LOCUS anagram of ‘this place’) and TTREE, which is ([B]ETTER;  The removal indicator for the first letter is ‘spending capital’ and the anagrind is ‘off’.  Someone better at botany than me will have to tell us why the wood is ‘valuable’ (or perhaps it was just the need to get the V at the start of the clue).
"
4094,"E.g. Lana, unusual girl’s name",ANGELA,"Definition: girl’s name
anagram of EG LANA;

4095,"He, with wit, edited jumbo, a conspicuous failure",WHITE ELEPHANT,"Definition: a conspicuous failure

"
4137,Membranes in the country for protecting you and me,INDUSIA,"Definition: Membranes
I always like it when I get a new word by figuring out the wordplay.  This is US for ‘you and me’ in INDIA.  ‘INDUSIUM: any of various thin membranous coverings’, says my SOED.  And it follows the ‘rule’ (ish) of Latin-based words ending in -IUM forming their plural in IA, whence INDUSIA.  So medium/media, millennium/millennia, equilibrium/equilibria.  I’d still write ‘stadiums’, though, because ‘stadia’ when one is talking with one’s fellow aficionados about footie sounds a bit poncy.
"
4138,Sort of car difficult to park initially,HARDTOP,"Definition: Sort of car
A charade of HARD, TO and P for the first letter of Park.
"
4139,Island stars in a group cutting the corn,CAPRI,"Definition: Island

Quixote is taking advantage of the flexibility of words like ‘on’ and ‘against’ this morning.  This is A CON for ‘a trick’ followed by IAN for the setters’ favourite Scotsman preceded by DR for ‘doctor’.  Although it’s naff all to do with the clue, Dr Finlay and Dr Cameron came into my mind when solving this, but I’m of a certain age.

A charade of PA for ‘old man’ anagram of AIR TERMINAL; and AN.  The anagrind is ‘wobbling’.  Not sure why Quixote has put the question mark in here; it works fine for me without it.

Not a familiar word for me, so I had to wait for a few crossers before I could have a stab at the anagram.  It’s anagram of HAM IS IS; and the dish itself is thinly sliced raw seafood.  Which doesn’t fit my definition of ‘edible’, and is therefore the reason I’d never heard of it.

4175,Certain detail on which no one comes up with an explanation,DEFINITION,"Definition: an explanation
If you’re one of those who is using the Quiptic as an introduction to the cryptic world, then I guess sooner or later you’re going to have to learn about the ‘detail’ device.  It’s meant to be read as de-tail, in other words ‘take the tail off’.  If you do that to DEFINIT[E] and follow that with an inversion (‘comes up’, because it’s a down clue) of NO I, you’ll have the answer.  I don’t think DEFINITION is a good definition of ‘explanation’, though.

Unless I’m being really dim, this doesn’t work for me.  It’s RAN for ‘organised’ and COROUS as a purported homophone of ‘chorus’ for ‘musical ensemble’.  But if you say RAN CHORUS, it doesn’t sound anything like RANCOROUS.  Where I come from, anyway.  People like Jonathan Ross try as a rule to find a synonym for RANCOUR.

It’s a cd, I suppose, but it’s a phrase I’ve never heard.  Certainly, a PEOPLE PERSON is used to describe someone with good interpersonal skills, but I suppose if ever I were to need the plural, I’d say PEOPLE PERSONS, although that sounds a bit ugly.  But PEOPLE PEOPLE?  Don’t think so.

This was my favourite today.  It’s PEED for ‘went’ in SING for ‘carol’ in its verbal Xmas sense.
"
4252,King reportedly returned without page in disgust,REPEL,"Definition: disgust
Well, LEER is a homophone of LEAR in anyone’s language, so it’s a reversal of that with an insertion of P for ‘page’.  ‘Without’ is the insertion indicator; it’s the opposite of ‘within’ meaning ‘inside’; thus ‘outside’.  In everyday usage, mainly Scottish, I think.  Will Scotland be without the United Kingdom after the referendum?

4485,"Reading this may get one over sin, might we deduce?",REVISED VERSION,"Definition: Reading this may get one over sin
The technical description of this clue is a reverse anagram thingy with a hint of &lit.  In fact, if Everyman had omitted the last three words of the clue, which he could easily have done, I could have described it as &lit without risking being mauled by the &lit rottweilers that lurk just below the surface on this site, waiting to sink their teeth into bloggers who say a clue is &lit when it’s not.  Whatevs, if you take REVISED as an anagrind, then VERSION could become ‘over sin’.  And reading the REVISED VERSION of the Bible could well help you to get over your sins.  For newer solvers, ‘&lit’ is crosswordese for ‘and literally so’, where the whole clue leads to the answer.  Sometimes called an ‘all-in-one’ clue.

4543,Islander appreciated Scotsman landing punch,TAHITIAN,"Definition: Islander
I think this is HIT for ‘punch’ inserted in TA for ‘appreciated’ and IAN for the setters’ favourite ‘Scotsman’, but I can’t see how ‘landing’ is the insertion indicator, except perhaps in the sense of ‘getting’.  ‘I got/landed the job.’  TAHITI always reminds me of the paintings of Paul Gauguin.

"
4588,Glower maybe as loveless type full of energy,HEATER,"Definition: Glower maybe
It works, but not my favourite ever Quixote clue.  A ‘glower maybe’ is a HEATER.  Then it’s E inserted in HATER, with the misdirection being in taking ‘glower’ as a verb and not a noun.  The surface is a bit naff.

4601,"The boss?  You may see a scolding type in this person, right?",MANAGER,"Definition: The boss
Well, the definition is clear enough, but the parsing took me a while.  You need to put A NAG for ‘a scolding type’ in ME for ‘this person’, then follow it with R for ‘right’.  More flipping football in the Indy.  Do the setters and the editor never listen to customer feedback?
"

"
4644,10 man’s address given to wife with love handles?,MR WHIPPY,"Definition: 10
The famous ice-cream is MR, which is how you ‘address’ a man, W for ‘wife’ and HIPPY, which is an extremely whimsical way of describing ‘love handles’, the rolls of fat around the waistline and hips.  They are called love handles because they may be used to grab onto, in a handle-like way, during coitus in certain positions.  I couldn’t possibly comment.

"
4647,United supporter standing by as Maradona scored,MANUALLY,"Definition: as Maradona scored
I teased in my last blog about there being too much football in the Indy, but this will not amuse those who really don’t like it, because you do have to know stuff about the beautiful game to parse it, if not to solve it.  ‘United’ is MANU and ALLY is ‘supporter’.  Diego Maradona scored a controversial goal in the quarter-final of the 1986 World Cup against England, when he illegally fisted the ball into the net with his hand during an aerial challenge with Peter Shilton, the England keeper, and claimed that it was the ‘Hand of God’ that had scored.  So he could be said to have scored MANUALLY.  Yer, I knew some of you wouldn’t like it.  Anyway, at the time he was considered to be the greatest player of his generation; but he later turned into a fat knacker and a drug addict.
"
4648,Tough-guy actor seen in Duchamp’s fountain perhaps?,BOGART,"Definition: Tough-guy actor
My felicitations if you knew what ‘Duchamp’s fountain’ was, ‘cos I certainly didn’t.  Turns out it’s a 1917 work of art by Marcel Duchamp which consisted of a porcelain urinal.  So it would be BOG ART – geddit?

"
4657,Browser’s functioning in apple.com according to helpline?,EYESIGHT,"Definition: Browser’s functioning
Again, I just can’t quite pin this down.  It’s more whimsy: suggesting that I-SIGHT might be an Apple product that sounds like (‘according to helpline’) EYESIGHT.  Perhaps that’s it, but over to you if not.
"
4658,Will actor broadcast in wild?,FERAL,"Definition: wild
Another homophone: of the actor Will FERRELL.  I’m not massively into cinema, but even I’d heard of him.
"
4659,East coast criminal acquiring unknown pot user’s paraphernalia,TEA COSY,"Definition: pot user’s paraphernalia
‘Criminal’ and ‘pot’ in the same clue?  Got to be drugs.  But that’s cryptic misdirection for you.  ‘Criminal’ is the anagrind for anagram of E COAST Y;  Y is one of the mathematical ‘unknowns’.  And the stuff you put in the ‘pot’ is much less damaging to your health, even if you didn’t inhale.
"
4660,A king who’s slightly on the spectrum,RICHARD OF YORK,"Definition: A king
Clever, clever … it’s referring to the mnemonic which teaches little ones the colours of the rainbow (‘spectrum’). RICHARD OF YORK GAVE BATTLE IN VAIN for red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.  And the soon to be Leicester-based monarch is only part of, or ‘slightly on’ that phrase.  Not everybody’s *tasse de thé*, but I liked it (when I finally got it).
"
4661,Contemporaries who are normally found around Duchamp’s fountain?,PEER GROUP,"Definition: Contemporaries
Quite a lot of bodily function in this puzzle.  Refer to 24ac.  If the lads all go to the urinal together during half-time at the match, we’d be a PEER GROUP, wouldn’t we?

"
4664,Perhaps Luther King’s second drink,MARTINI,"Definition: drink
This is going to start sounding like a love-in between the slogger and the better, but I thought this was really inventive too: it’s MARTIN plus I for the second letter of kIng.
"
4665,UCAS in mix-up over exam results in summer,ABACUS,"Definition: summer
An ABACUS does ‘sums’, so it’s A and B for ‘exam results’ followed by anagram of ACUS; with ‘mix-up’ as the anagrind.  Normally, ‘over’ in a down clue would indicate that the AB would come below ACUS.  Can it be an instruction to put the AB first?  You tell me.
"
4666,Drinks dispenser required Duracells – back up and running essentially,UDDER,"Definition: Drinks dispenser
Hidden reversed in requiRED DUracells.  Since this is a down clue, then ‘back up and running essentially’ is the rather long-winded reversal and hidden indicator, I think.  If that’s complete and udder nonsense, you’ll tell me, no doubt.

4688,Solo nerd translated medieval language,OLD NORSE,"Definition: medieval language
anagram of SOLO NERD;  I would usually associate ‘medieval’ with the Middle Ages, whereas Old Norse is much earlier; but my SOED does extend the definition back to 500AD, so fair enough.  OLD NORSE had an impact on Old English, and there are a number of modern words which are derived from it, including FRECKLE, HUSBAND, SKY and THEY/THEIR.  So know you know.

An insertion of OT in ERIC.  I personally wouldn’t say that EROTIC is a synonym of ‘amorous’, but I’m not going into my sexual history online, thank you very much.
"
4692,Philosopher getting hold of Swift’s third ironic composition,SATIRE,"Definition: ironic composition
I think the setter is suggesting that we make an insertion of I for the third letter of ‘Swift’ in SATRE.  However, the problem is that the French philosopher, and indeed much else, is called Jean-Paul SARTRE.  ‘*L’enfer, c’est les autres*‘ or ‘Hell is other people’ is one of his many quotes.  But his surname wasn’t SATRE.
"
4693,"Song and dance, to a degree",BALLAD,"Definition: Song

’SHEAA charade of O, SHE and A, referring to Tessie O’SHEA, the Welsh music-hall entertainer.  The enumeration given for this clue struck me.  It was (1’4), indicating the apostrophe in the answer.  Can’t remember ever seeing that before.  Normally it would just be (5).  And an &lit, or ‘all-in-one’ clue.
"

"
4706,Loan shark certain to be seen in ancient city,USURER,"Definition: Loan shark
An insertion of SURE in UR for the setters’ favourite ‘ancient city’.  USURER is not perhaps a word in most people’s active vocabulary, but if you’ve been doing cryptics for a bit, then you will certainly have come across it.
"
4707,"Changing at the front, rowing crew in large bay",BIGHT,"Definition: large bay
Everyman is inviting you to think of EIGHT for a ‘rowing crew’ and then change the first letter.  North Utsire, South Utsire, Fisher, German Bight … for aficionados of the Shipping Forecast.

Another insertion: of A in TOGS.
"
4720,"Hen, perhaps, in film",LAYER,"Definition: Hen, perhapsfilm
Everyman often gives us an old film as a solution, but this is a double bluff and a double definition, since a hen is a LAYER of eggs.
"
4721,"Teach, perhaps, putting vermin in pastry",PIRATE,"Definition: Teach, perhaps
Pretty obvious what the answer was – it’s RAT in PIE – but I had to ask a fellow blogger how we get to ‘teach’ from PIRATE.  Turns out it’s Edward Teach, also known as Blackbeard, the infamous English pirate from the 18th century.  So there you go.
"
4722,Vigorous Chelsea regularly imprisoned in upper room,ATHLETIC,"Definition: Vigorous
An insertion of HLE for the even letters of ‘Chelsea’ in ATTIC.  The surface reads better, I think, if you take Chelsea to be a girl’s name rather than a football team.
"
4723,Active Liberal returns and draws one’s talents,ABILITIES,"Definition: talents
I can’t make this work, so am going into ask the audience mode.  The elements are – I think – A for ‘active’, BIL for a reversal of LIB, TIES for ‘draws’ and I for ‘one’.  But I can’t see how the cryptic grammar is telling us to put it together to get ABILITIES.

A charade of OVERS for ‘bowling’, P for the musical instruction for ‘quietly’ and ILL.
"
4735,"Take a turn from surgery, troubled about when to get nutritious food for cattle",RYEGRASS,"Definition: nutritious food for cattle
I suppose that Alchemi is conjuring up an image of a veterinary surgery.  This is what I meant when I said this setter’s cluing style is sometimes elaborate: you need to take U for ‘turn’, as in U-TURN, out of ‘surgery’, then make an anagram (‘troubled’) and then insert AS for ‘when’ into all that.  RYEGRASS is indeed a pasture grass, but it’s most likely not in everyone’s passive vocabulary.  However, that’s what crossing letters are for, and ‘food for cattle’ is likely to contain GRASS, innit?
"
4736,"Roger, possibly by the grace of God, captured by man of action",DODGER,"Definition: Roger, possibly
This surface and clue I did like.  ROGER THE DODGER is the comic book character; put DG for *Dei Gratia*, the Latin phrase for ‘by the grace of God’ in DOER and you’ve got the rascal.

4745,Be wiser than to report on monarch’s improving health,KNOW BETTER,"Definition: Be wiser thanto report on monarch’s improving health
I spent ages looking for an ancient king or queen that was a homophone of KNOW, but I don’t think there is one.  So it must be K NOW BETTER, unless someone else knows better.
"
4746,"Cross setter, say, about to get pregnant",EXPECTING,"Definition: pregnant
A good clue.  The ‘cross’ is X; the ‘setter’ is PECTIN (jam makers will explain it) and you need to put EG for ‘say’ around all that.

Ed Balls has been a gift to setters since he became a high-profile politician.  Normally he gives us ED; but here the capitalisation is a misdirection.  It’s the Yorkshire/Lancashire River RIBBLE in DR.

Another insertion, of OU for Open University, or ‘seat of learning’ in RUINS.
"
4749,Hesitate to pursue the two in trouble,BOTHER,"Definition: trouble
It’s a charade of BOTH and ER.  The surface suggests that ER is a verb, which I was going to have a chunter about.  But my SOED says ‘verb, intransitive’, so I’ll de-chunter.  I er, you er, he/she/it ers?  Never trust dictionaries.  ‘He was umming and erring’, I suppose.

If you ‘dishearten’ ‘several’ you’ll end up with SL.  Put two letter Os outside that and you’ve got a city with a latitude of 59.50 degrees north.  Which qualifies it to be northern, I think.

4796,Broken bits the woman’s taken across the road,SHERDS,"Definition: Broken bits
Bit of an alternative spelling bee this morning.  My Collins says it’s an another spelling of SHARDS, so it’s RD in SHE’S.  Not sure why the setter chose this as the solution, since there are several other more common words that fit this pattern.

"
4821,Come out? Some who went here may have done so afterwards,FINISHING SCHOOL,"A cd.  It’s not ‘come out’ in the ‘reveal your sexuality’ sense.  FINISHING SCHOOLS were (perhaps still are) institutions – mainly in Switzerland – where young women from privileged backgrounds spent a year learning etiquette, what order to use their cutlery in, and how to get out of a Rolls-Royce without flashing their expensive knickers.  After that, they ‘come out’ into upper class society at debutante balls in order to be introduced to rich men.  At least I think that’s what this clue is about.

Two ‘Russells’ at completely opposite ends of the intellectual scale.  BERTRAND RUSSELL, one of the 20th century’s greatest intellects and perhaps best known for his *History of Western Philosophy*.  And RUSSELL BRAND, perhaps best known for being a dickhead.  Put ER T inside the latter and you’ve got the former.

A charade of F for the old French currency, the Franc, and OB for Old Boy or ‘alumnus’.  Many people will know this from FOB WATCH or FOB CHAIN, but it does have a meaning of the ‘pocket’ in which you’d keep said watch.  And it doesn’t seem to be etymologically related to FOB OFF, I discovered.

"
4839,Lead journalist behind river in outdoor resting place,CAMP BED,"Definition: outdoor resting place
English is an ideal language for cryptics, because often the same word can be a verb or noun.  Like ‘lead’.  In the surface, Hypnos is using it as a verb (as in ‘lead someone astray’).  But in the definition, you have to take it as a noun, the metallic element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb.  So it’s a charade of CAM for the river where punting goes on, PB and ED for ‘journalist’

"
4843,Characteristic of a kipper?,COMATOSE,"Definition: Characteristic of a kipper

"
4845,A large number welcoming a Palestinian,ARAFAT,"Definition: Palestinian

A charade of TRENT and ON, referencing the River TRENT and the New Jersey capital city.  We’re more used to seeing ON TRENT, of course: Stoke-on-Trent, Newark-on-Trent.  But – strictly – it’s Burton-upon-Trent.
"
4852,Sailor on Northern lake,TARN,"Definition: lake
A simple charade of TAR and N.  ‘Northern’ lake is a nice touch, since TARN is ultimately an old Norse word and its usage is mainly confined to the North of England.  FELL and BECK are other examples of such Norse words to do with landscape that are similarly confined.

Well, I put in HOLDS WITH to start with, which works, I think.  But Nutmeg’s way is to suggest that the broomstick BEARS WITCH, so when you’ve removed C for ‘Catholic’ from the second word, you’ve got your answer.

anagram of LIKES NY;  The NY bit is the outside letters of ‘newsworthy’.
"
4985,Remedies all working in poet’s place,EMERALD ISLE,"Definition: poet’s place
anagram of REMEDIES ALL;  Pretty obvious anagram, but why is the EMERALD ISLE a ‘poet’s place’?  The answer, it seems, is that the phrase was first coined in a poem by William Drennan, *When Erin First Rose*, the first four lines of which are:
"
4986,"When Erin first rose from the dark swelling flood,",G,"od bless’d the green island and saw it was good;*The em’rald of Europe, it sparkled and shone,*
"
4987,"Visionary (?) work, Italian recalled, with unlimited scale",OPTICAL,"Definition: Visionary

"
4991,"Language after drink dire, discourteous, vile in the end?",MALTESE,"Definition: Language
A charade of MALT for a ‘drink’ of whisky, and ESE for the final letters of ‘dire, discourteous, vile’.  A tricky clue.  It’s enough to make a Maltese cross.
"
4992,Achievement – girl reaches shelter,EVEREST,"Definition: Achievement
This was my last one in, and I didn’t like it very much.  E?E?E?T can be lots of things; EVEREST is an ‘achievement’, I suppose, but so are lots of other things; and ‘girl’ certainly could be lots of things.  Whatever, it’s EVE and REST.
"
4993,Artist covering seaside feature and weapon of old,RAPIER,"Definition: weapon of old
A charade of RA for ‘artist’ and PIER.
"
4994,Clingy guy’s entering a seedy joint,ADHESIVE,"Definition: Clingy

anagram of FEE LIMIT; with ‘reviewed’ as the anagrind.
"
4999,Master organised pupils,STREAM,"Definition: pupils
anagram of MASTER; with ‘organised’ as the anagrind.  Nice surface, but perhaps ‘pupils’ for STREAM is a bit of a stretch.  A stream, B stream …

The middle of ‘poor’ is OO; an insertion of anagram of TRAIN; in that gives you the Canadian province.
"
5018,New element in trap producing admission by spy?,IMPLANT,"Definition: New element in trapadmission by spy
Well, I’m guessing that the setter is alluding to the fact that if you went to the dentist for an IMPLANT, then you’d have a ‘new element’ in your ‘trap’ or mouth.  And that if a spy was giving the game away, he’d say I’M [a] PLANT.  In which case, it’s a dd.  But you may have a better explanation.
"

An insertion of anagram of TILING; in GEE!  The surface is not painting a picture in my head.

An insertion of N in IDOL followed by [P]ENCE.
"
5028,Take away class in school,REMOVE,"I’ll have a stab at this and say that it’s an attempt at an &lit, where if you were studying RE (a ‘class’ or subject) and you had to be ‘taken away’, then it would be an RE MOVE.  And REMOVE is to ‘take away’.  But that’s most likely pants.  *Edit: it is indeed complete and utter pants.  See comments one and two.*
"

ÑOanagram of ONLINE;
"
5030,"Fish, perhaps, tiresome lot to go off",METEOROLOGIST,"Definition: Fish, perhaps
anagram of TIRESOME LOT TO GO; with ‘off’ as the anagrind.  Referring to Michael FISH, the METEOROLOGIST and BBC weather forecaster who famously said of the Great Storm of 1987 that there wasn’t going to be a hurricane.  He was right; it wasn’t a hurricane.  But it still did a lot of damage.  Can fish be tiresome?

"
5036,Advertising a party in gallery abroad,PRADO,"Definition: gallery abroad
A charade of PR for ‘public relations’ and A DO for the gallery in Madrid.  Other setters do this as well, but I wish they’d stop.  I have a background in Marketing, and Public Relations is not synonymous with advertising.

A charade of CARP and ENTRY.
"
5038,Craze on One Direction’s in decline,FADE,"Definition: decline

A charade of PA, RAN and the even letters (‘alternatively’) of ‘logical’.
"
5040,Was completely used to feeling lustful about Romeo,RAN DRY,"Definition: Was completely used
Hectence is relying on the fact that you can pronounce ‘used’ two different ways: one with an ‘s’ sound and the other with a ‘z’ sound.  You need the latter for the definition but the former for the surface.  Romeo here is not one of the star-cross’d lovers, but a letter in the phonetic alphabet: it’s R in RANDY.
"
5041,Naughty thing’s wearing blue that’s very revealing!,SKIMPY,"Definition: very revealing
IMP for a ‘naughty thing’ is covered by SKY for ‘blue’.
"
5042,Examine underground lab equipment,TEST TUBE,"Definition: lab equipment

A charade of WANT, O and N.
"
5044,"Mac cartoon loses nothing in translation, having excellent content",RAINCOAT,"Definition: Mac
Bit complicated to parse: you need to take O for ‘nothing’ out of ‘cartoon’, make an anagram anagram of CARTON; and then stick A1 for ‘excellent’ in that.  Mac is indeed a cartoonist, in a paper whose name I can’t bring myself to mention.  But it was the one that was forced to apologise recently – although grudgingly – for saying that the Milibands’ father hated Britain.
"
5045,Sure about route?,OF COURSE,"Definition: Sure
A charade of OF and COURSE.
"
5046,Old coin possibly does contain copper,ESCUDO,"Definition: Old coin

A charade of SCA[B] and anagram of NIGHT; with ‘shift’ as the anagrind.
"
5048,Hurts‘ cheerful performance gets small following,UPSETS,"Definition: Hurts
It’s a charade of UP for ‘cheerful’, SET for ‘performance’ and S for ‘small’.  I’m confused about the apostrophe, because the surface would have to suggest that there is an actor called Hurts.  That surname does exist, but it’s mainly Dutch or Flemish, and I think Hectence is alluding to John HURT, who has had a long and distinguished career.  So I dunno.
"
5049,"Whisks right on south, after taking M9 to Edinburgh, initially",MIXERS,"Definition: Whisks
R and S preceded by M IX for M9 in Roman numerals and E for the first letter of ‘Edinburgh’.

A charade of READ for ‘study’ and MIT for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"
5055,Joanna Blackwood?,EBONY,"Definition: Joanna Blackwood
Well, EBONY is a ‘black wood’ and I think this is referring to the fact that a piano, or ‘Joanna’ in Cockney rhyming slang, is composed of IVORY and EBONY, referring to the black and white keys.  But if you have a better idea …
"
5056,Renegade‘s skill is to go about organising riot,TRAITOR,"Definition: Renegade

"
5057,Duke’s rent from God’s own county!,YORKSHIRE,"Definition: God’s own county

"
5059,A local fixture?,DART BOARD,"Definition: A local fixture

"
5061,Cuss rain that’s knocked over sunflower,NARCISSUS,"Definition: flower
A charade of anagram of CUSS RAIN; and S for ‘sun’.  What some folk call a ‘lift and separate’ clue, since you have to disabuse yourself of the idea that ‘sunflower’ should be considered as one word.  These setters have no end of wiles.
"
5062,Busy working man’s after time to take leave,ON THE GO,"Definition: Busy
A charade of ON for ‘working’, THE for ‘man after time’ and GO.
"
5063,Intending to marry with aim to secure good number of years,ENGAGED,"Definition: Intending to marry

"
5064,Caught donkey very enthralled by acres of tropical food,CASSAVA,"Definition: tropical food
A charade of C, ASS and V in two A’s for ‘acres’.  It’s a tropical root vegetable, but you knew that already.
"
5065,Not in shape for fun run I finish fourth from last,UNFIT,"Definition: Not in shape
Perhaps in a slightly ungainly way, Hectence is telling us to make an anagram (‘run’) of FUN, follow it by I, and then that the ‘finish’ of the word is the fourth letter of ‘last’.  The surface is good, though.
"
5066,Small alteration to model’s ineffectual,TWEAK,"Definition: Small alteration
The Ford Model T (‘any colour you want as long as it’s black’) is followed by WEAK for ‘ineffectual’.
"
5067,"Rank junk in Texas, say?",STATUS,"Definition: Rank
An insertion of TAT in S US, since Texas is indubitably in the Southern United States.
"
5068,Young leaders in African territories shut in houses,IMMATURE,"Definition: Young
Another insertion: of AT for the first letters of ‘African territories’ in IMMURE, which means to ‘shut in’ or ‘wall in’.  The cryptic grammar is fine; you just have to put some kind of mental punctuation between ‘territories’ and ‘shut’.  IMMURE is not an everyday word, but is related to the French *le mur* for ‘wall’.
"
5069,Become a mummy?  You must be joking!,GET STUFFED,"Definition: Become a mummyYou must be joking
A cd cum dd.  If you were an Egyptian mummy, you’d have been stuffed with natron as part of the embalming process.

"
5071,Prayer recalling peak in mountain range,CHAPLAIN,"Definition: Prayer
It’s ALP reversed in CHAIN.  Punk is using a whimsical definition of CHAPLAIN – one who prays, therefore a ‘prayer’.
"
5072,Measures required to secure new jumpers – I stand by it as the easiest way,LINE OF LEAST RESISTANCE,"Definition: the easiest way
Congratulations if you got this from the wordplay and not from the enumeration.  It’s NEO for ‘new’ and FLEAS for ‘jumpers’ in LITRES for ‘measures’ all followed by I and STANCE for ‘stand’.

"
5083,"Popular item is forced in at last, to a very minor degree",INFINITESIMALLY,"Definition: to a very minor degree
It’s a bit convoluted: IN for ‘popular’ followed by anagram of ITEM IS; in FINALLY.  The anagrind is ‘forced’ and the insertion indicator is ‘in’.

"
5086,Sly character has run into lad wiping bottom,RAMBO,"Definition: Sly character

5138,Publicity line penned by poet?  It’s prominent in paper,HEADLINE,"Definition: It’s prominent in paper

anagram of LOST ERA I I;
"
5140,Rejoin a ride that’s winding over foreign port,RIO DE JANEIRO,"Definition: foreign port

A charade of J for ‘Justice’ anagram of as in JP) and (EX PM MANY ARE;  Topical clue, since Paxo stepped down from *Newsnight* last week.  Overly aggressive and sneering, for sure, but given that his starting point for interviewing politicians was ‘Why is this bastard lying to me?’ then you can’t help but like him.
"
5145,General sign of marriage discontenting lady with a sidelong look,LEERINGLY,"Definition: with a sidelong look
A charade of LEE, RING and LY for the outside letters of ‘lady’.  ‘Discontenting’ is an invitation to ‘remove the contents of’.  The surface seems meaningless and I’m not sure that I’d describe a ‘sidelong look’ as a LEER.  Suggestive look, perhaps.
"
5146,Giant creature hard to detect among two small ones?  Yes and no!,BEHEMOTH,"Definition: Giant creature
An insertion of H for ‘hard’ in BEE and MOTH.  The clue for me stops at the question mark, so I can’t see what the ‘Yes and no!’ bit is doing.  Happen I’m missing something.

"
5160,A different Chevalier crest for powered tool,ELECTRIC SHAVER,"Definition: powered tool
anagram of CHEVALIER CREST;  Perhaps ‘powered tool’ is a bit OTT for something that you just use to remove stubble, but the clue is fair enough.

AL[I]AS.

A clever charade of S, TOW and AWAY.
"
5167,These American political adherents are undemocratic!,REPUBLICANS,"Definition: These American political adherents

"
5171,Young redhead produces a mild spice,GREEN GINGER,"Definition: mild spice
A charade of GREEN for ‘young’ in its ‘inexperienced’ sense, and GINGER for ‘redhead’.  Not a spice I’d heard of before, but apparently it’s just less mature ginger, making it less pungent (hence ‘mild’).  And it’s not green.  Also called young ginger, spring ginger, new ginger, stem ginger, pink ginger or baby ginger.  The last of these would have been a favourite of the Spice Girls.

5178,Accomplish the removal of rights without revolutionary communist,ATTAIN,"Definition: Accomplish
‘Revolutionary communist’ is usually DER, but beyond that I have absolutely no idea how this works, so help appreciated.  In fact, hold your horses: on writing up the blog I decided to see if there was such a word as ATTAINDER.  There is.  Not quite the kind of word I would expect to have to know for a Monday Indy, but hey ho.
"
5179,Fool describing endless lust in a manner of speaking,IDIOLECT,"Definition: a manner of speaking
An insertion of LEC[H] in IDIOT.  A word I did know, but I had to check the exact definition: ‘the variety or form of a language used by an individual’ (Collins).

A charade of BASE and BALL.
"
5181,Legal reasons for numberless allowances,RATIOS,"Definition: Legal reasons
RATIO[N]S.  *Ratio decidendi* is a legal Latin phrase meaning ‘the reason’.  I so knew that.  However, since Kairos has chosen to take us into arcane territory, I will point out that the plural would be *Rationes decidendi*, so I’m not sure that RATIOS really works.  A lawyer may tell me otherwise.

A charade of I and anagram of ENDLESS;
"
5183,Disorder revealed by septum bleeding,TUMBLE,"Definition: Disorder

There is a bit of parsing to do in this puzzle.  An insertion of RR for ‘Right Reverend’ or ‘bishop’ and UP for ‘high’ in COT for ‘cotangent’, which is a mathematical ‘function’.  The length of the adjacent side of a triangle divided by the length of the opposite side, since you ask.  Brilliant surface.  Although I’m certain no actual bishop has ever found himself in that situation.  They’re all much too pious to do drugs.
"
5186,Encourages magazine to get rid of old type of paper,EGGSHELL,"Definition: type of paper
A charade of EGGS and HELL[O].  For those unfamiliar with *Hello!*, it is filled with mind-numbingly boring crap about Z-list slebs and Wills ‘n’ Kate.  And their inbred baby, whatever it’s called.
"
5187,Football pundit biting the head off listener?,HEARER,"Definition: listener
Another removal required here: [S]HEARER.  This clue is faulty.  Alan SHEARER could by no stretch of the imagination be called a ‘football pundit’.  Spouting monotonal, monotonous and monochromal platitudes is not punditry.  Good grief, I’m grumpy this morning.
"
5188,Lesson of Irish rock group heard to be in hardship,TUTORIAL,"Definition: Lesson
U2 is the ‘Irish rock group’ (Bono and his mates).  A homophone of that (U TO) in TRIAL gives you your answer.

"
5191,Adopt a noncommittal attitude to burden engulfing trustee,STRADDLE,"Definition: Adopt a noncommittal attitude to
I assume that this is TR in SADDLE.  TR for ‘trustee’ isn’t in any of my dictionaries (and no, I don’t have Chambers).  This definition of STRADDLE, ‘to be in favour of both sides of something’ is marked in Collins as* US and Canadian informal*.  I’d certainly never use it in this sense.
"
5192,Flowers in competition provided by yours truly,RACEME,"Definition: Flowers
A charade of RACE and ME.
"
5193,Bug – one seen in green soup!,ENRAGE,"Definition: Bug

"
5197,Prime self-contained house on the outskirts of Oakhill,SCHOOL,"Definition: Prime
I guess it’s ‘prime’ in its sense of ‘prepare’.  SC for self-contained?  Not one I’ve heard of.  Then it’s HO, and OL for the outside letters of ‘Oakhill’.
"
5198,One may contribute coyly to a four-letter word,ASTERISK,"Definition: One may contribute coyly to a four-letter word
Well, strictly it would need four of them to make that particular ****ing contribution; but I think we know where the setter is coming from.
"
5199,Advocate attending unfashionable game in America,ATTORNEY,"Definition: Advocate
A charade of AT and TO[U]RNEY.  TOURNEY for me is a medieval joust; but someone will tell me that it’s American English as well.  The removal of the U refers to U and NON-U.
"
5200,Allot OAP accommodation in Californian city,PALO ALTO,"Definition: Californian city
anagram of ALLOT OAP;  ‘Accommodation’ can mean ‘arrangement’.   ‘We can come to an accommodation/arrangement.’  So it’s fine as an anagrind.

Since it’s a down clue, you need to insert the key that has two sharps in its signature in OUTSET for ‘opening’, and then reverse (‘up’) all that.
"
5202,Oilmen regularly discover short form of hydrocarbon,OLEFIN,"Definition: form of hydrocarbon
A charade of OLE for the odd letters of OiLmEn and FIN[D].  An OLEFIN is indeed a hydrocarbon, and is the petrochemical industry’s usual name for an alkene, so the surface is apposite.  The most basic ones are ethylene and propylene (nowadays, more strictly, ethene and propene).  If you polymerise them and break the double bonds to form long chains, a polymer, you have polyethylene (polythene) and polypropylene.  The former is used to produce plastic bags and the latter is used to make those containers you brought home from your last Tupperware party.
"
5203,Those present get a bit of upside-down cake,GATEAU,"Definition: cake
A charade of GATE, A and U for the first letter of ‘upside-down’.

5209,Small drop to drink before opening of Anouilh play,DRAMA,"Definition: play

A charade of anagram of CROSSES; and E.  Martin SCORSESE: best known perhaps for *Taxi Driver*, *Raging Bull* and *The Last Temptation of Christ*; but there’s plenty more to choose from if you don’t fancy any of those.

-HOTR for the first letter of ‘rash’ and anagram of DO THE;
"
5248,"Aristocrat loses heart, following brief part in government",CONTROL,"Definition: government

5249,Chuck out ecstasy and cocaine found in plane,EJECT,"Definition: Chuck out
You’ve got to know a bit about drugs to do these cryptic jobbies, haven’t you?  I’m absolutely certain that Hectence has never been busted for drugs, but here she is prompting you to make a charade of E for ‘ecstasy’ followed by an insertion of C for ‘cocaine’ in JET.

5254,"Puzzle‘s a shocker, containing central theme",TEASER,"Definition: Puzzle
An insertion of E for the middle letter of ‘theme’ in TASER, which would certainly shock you should a member of The Met ever choose to use it on you.  I just chose The Met randomly from all the police forces across the country, obviously.
"
5255,"Bookmaker sees local woman, 51, before start of race",PUBLISHER,"Definition: Bookmaker
It’s a charade of PUB for ‘local’, LI for the Roman numerals for ’51’, SHE and R for the first letter of ‘race’, but I’m not convinced that the cryptic grammar is telling us to put it all in that order.  Am I missing something?
"
5256,Drive old Hillman and set off round bend,IMPETUS,"Definition: Drive
The dear old Hillman IMP is followed by U for a type of ‘bend’ in anagram of SET;

"
5258,Red planet endlessly circles on pole,MAROON,"Definition: Red

"
5267,"196 enter shambolically, following Scottish drunk about to get into touring party",FOURTEEN SQUARED,"Definition: 196
If ever there was a meaningless surface and a random clue, this is surely it.  FOURTEEN SQUARED is indeed 196.  FOU is French for ‘crazy’ and also, apparently, a Scottish dialect word for ‘drunk’ (no, I hadn’t either).  This is followed by RTEEN (an anagram, ‘shambolically’, of ENTER) and then an insertion of RE (‘about’) in SQUAD for ‘touring party’.
"
5268,Battle over point with heartless bouncer too violent for 2?,CUBE ROOT OF EIGHT,"Definition: 2
I refer the right honourable ladies and gentlemen to my comment at 14ac. The CUBE ROOT OF EIGHT is indeed 2.  FEIGHT is a ‘battle’ or FIGHT around (‘over’) E, which is a ‘point’ of the compass.  CUBEROOTO is an anagram (‘violent’) of TOO and BOU[N]CER, with ‘heartless’ as the removal indicator.
"
5269,Finish 2 men’s rotten gifts,ENDOWMENTS,"Definition: gifts
A charade of END and anagram of TWO MENS; with ‘rotten’ as the anagrind.  Why put ‘2’ into the clue when TWO would have worked just as well?  Perhaps there’s a theme here that I’m missing and it’s something to do with the ‘2’ in 17ac.
"
5270,"Attacks amateur avarice, perhaps by sending books back",LAYS INTO,"Definition: Attacks
Another surface reading that didn’t hit the spot for me.  It’s a charade of LAY, SIN and TO for a reversal (‘back’) of OT for Old Testament or ‘books’.

"
5274,Innocent-looking party employee starting to bring back the old Labour leader,DOE,"Definition: Innocent-looking
-EYEDAnother multi-part clue that took some time to parse.  It’s DO for ‘party’, followed by E for ’employee’ starting, then EY for a reversal of YE for ‘the old’, followed by ED for Ed Miliband, who is the current Labour leader.  Too complicated for this puzzle, imho.  And YE was never an old word for ‘the’, although it’s enough of an urban myth for Alchemi to include it in his clue.  It was just* þe*, employing the Old English letter thorn, *þ*, and was still pronounced ‘the’.  So try to find an alternative to YE OLDE COFFEE SHOPPE if you’re in need of caffeine.
"
5275,"Court official‘s trouble, getting hit outside",BAILIFF,"Definition: Court official
An insertion of AIL in BIFF for ‘hit’.

I’m sure this is very witty, but I have no idea what it’s about.
"
5282,Agree to keep mixed suet and mint,NOT USED,"Definition: mint
Well, I suppose that ‘mint’ can mean NOT USED, so it’s anagram of SUET; in NOD.
"
5283,Back line-up to get drawn with Sweden following talking-to,STERN WORDS,"Definition: talking-to
A charade of STERN for ‘back’, a reversal (‘up’) of ROW for ‘line’, D for ‘drawn’ and S for ‘Sweden’.  But I don’t think I’ve ever used STERN WORDS to mean a ‘talking-to’.  HARSH WORDS, perhaps, or just WORDS.
"
5284,Somehow rang every 1970s bus driver seen on TV,REG VARNEY,"Definition: 1970s bus driver seen on TV
anagram of RANG EVERY; with ‘somehow’ as the anagrind.  If you weren’t alive or awake during the 1970s and didn’t watch *On The Buses*, then you would have struggled with this.

A charade of O, NENE for the river that flows through Peterborough and SS for ‘boat’.
"
5287,Unconscious having perhaps caught disease,OUT COLD,"Definition: Unconscious
A charade, and a reference to cricket.  If you are ‘perhaps caught’ you are OUT.  And COLD is, I suppose, a mild ‘disease’.  Except if it’s a man-cold, in which case it’s a full-on, life-threatening disease which requires 24/7 care.
"
5288,The first American Bob fought,TUSSLED,"Definition: fought
A charade of T for the first letter of ‘the’, US for ‘American’ and SLED for ‘bob’, as in ‘bobsleigh’.
"
5289,French son gets lighter,DAWNS,"Definition: gets lighter

"
5293,Theatre-goers here present for heartthrob,GOD,"Definition: heartthrob
’S GIFTA charade of GODS (as ‘up in the gods’) and GIFT.  I don’t think ‘heartthrob’ and GOD’S GIFT are the same thing: the former is positive but the latter has a sense of only the man himself thinking that he is attractive to the opposite sex.
"
5294,River that’s out of this world?  Oder perhaps,POET,"Definition: Oder perhaps
Well, it’s a charade of the river PO and ET for ‘extra-terrestrial’, and the River Oder is in Germany.  But the suggestion is that Oder is also a poet, but I can’t find any reference to him or her.  Can anyone help?
"
5295,School member has wander without male companion,ROACH,"Definition: School member
A charade of ROA[M] and CH for Companion of Honour.  I think it’s just suggesting that a ROACH, being a fish, could be part of a ‘school’ of said animal.  Although from what little I know of the species, I think they are solitary creatures.
"
5296,Seafaring group finally escape out of wrecked liner,RNLI,"Definition: Seafaring group
Scorpion is asking you to take E for the last letter of ‘escape’ out of LIN[E]R and make an anagram (‘wrecked’).  For overseas solvers and lurkers, it’s the abbreviation for the Royal National Lifeboat Institute.

"
5302,Hints at going over ridge,CUESTA,"Definition: ridge
A charade of CUES and a reversal of AT.  ‘A long, low ridge with a steep scarp slope and a gentle back slope’, says Collins.  And it’s the Spanish word for ‘slope’.  So now you know.
"
5303,Alsatian I found on sun terrace somewhere in the Balkans,SKOPJE,"Definition: somewhere in the Balkans
A charade of S for ‘sun’, KOP for ‘terrace’ (most famously at Anfield, where Liverpool play and it’s called the Spion Kop after the Boer War battle) and JE.  Why JE?  Because Alsace is a beautiful region of Eastern France, notable for its Germanic character and cuisine.  So an Alsatian would say JE for ‘I’.
"
5304,A certain cosmetic that Sarah Millican uses?,ONE,"Definition: Sarah Millican uses
-LINERA charade of ONE and (EYE) LINER.  Referring the the South Shields-born comedian.  If you ever go to see her live, be prepared: she’s a great deal ruder than on the telly.  But also very, very funny.
"
5305,"1990s film cut down, limiting extremely riotous behaviour",MRS BROWN,"Definition: 1990s film
An insertion of RS and BR for the outside letters of ‘riotous’ and ‘behaviour’ in MOWN.  Judi Dench as Queen Vic and Billy Connelly as her servant John BROWN.  Tongues wagged, and behind her back she was referred to as MRS BROWN.  Good film.

A reversal of E and LAY for an archaic word for ‘poem’.
"
5307,Posh Londoners here taking seconds by limo to find patisserie,SWISS ROLLS,"Definition: patisserie
I wasn’t mad keen on this clue.  It’s a charade of SWI for Londoners who live in the ‘posh’ postal code of SW1, SS for ‘seconds’ and ROLLS.  SWISS ROLLS for ‘patisserie’ is a bit random, I think.
"
5308,Top-class game by chap capturing a nation,URUGUAY,"Definition: nation
A charade of U (as in U and non-U), RU for ‘Rugby Union’ and A in GUY.  Their football team lacks bite.

"
5310,Dance with nameless Europeans ending in aft part of boat,JIGGER,"Definition: part of boat
-MASTWell, to get the Nina in I guess there had to be some obscure clues.  It’s JIG, GERMA[N]S and T for the last letter of ‘aft’.
"
5311,Engineer providing iron in the Spanish arena,EIFFEL,"Definition: Engineer
An insertion of IF and FE in EL for one of the Spanish words for ‘the’.  I think ‘arena’ is there just to help the surface.  He of La Tour Eiffel fame, although from memory I think he also had something to do with the Statue of Liberty.
"
5312,"Written copy one nicked from school’s underground cell, we hear",TRANSCRIPT,"Definition: Written copy
A charade of TRA[I]NS and CRIPT, which is a homophone of CRYPT.

Hidden in thE NOUGHties.  The ‘noughties’ was coined to cover the decade from 2000 onwards; but we don’t seem to have found an equivalent for the decade we are in now.  We’ll have to wait for the ‘twenties’.  Pedants can queue up to tell me that decades start in 2001, 2011, etc, but I won’t pay any attention to them.

"
5410,Coppers mostly and 49 shillings found in drawers,PENCILS,"Definition: drawers
A charade of PENC[E], IL and S.  Many people would consider IL for ’49’ in Roman numerals to be wrong.  But we get IC for ’99’, and that’s wrong too.  They follow the pattern of IV for ‘4’ (one less than V, or 5), but strictly you can’t do it with 50 or 100.  Unless you’re a crossword setter.

A charade of MET, A and TARSUS.  St Paul was a native of Tarsus and his original name was Saul of Tarsus.  You have five of them in each foot, so METATARSI would be more accurate; but *pied-à-terre* literally means ‘foot on the ground’, so that’s where the setter is coming from.  ‘North’ works because it’s a down clue.  Still too many football-related clues in the Indy.

An insertion of RED and AM in NOTE.  If Raich is referring to *la Cathédrale Notre Dame de Paris*, then strictly it’s a cathedral.  But all cathedrals are churches; whereas not all churches are cathedrals.  We’ll move on.
"
5444,Showing care to be in legal position in box,CONSIDERATE,"Definition: Showing care
The beautiful game makes its appearance: this is ONSIDE in CRATE.  If the foremost forward is ONSIDE, he’s in a ‘legal position’, even if he’s outside the box.  I can get some salt and pepper pots out to explain this to those who hate football.  Although even I have lost the plot with what ‘not interfering with play’ means.

An insertion of A and R for ‘Regina’ in SONG.
"
5454,Bloc (no outsiders) with euro cents in circulation?,THE LOW COUNTRIES,"Definition: Bloc
I especially liked this one as well, although it took me ages to see it.  It’s anagram of [B]LO[C] WITH EURO CENTS; and ‘in circulation’ as the anagrind.  The definition is ‘bloc’, since informally THE LOW COUNTRIES refers to Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.  All those three countries use the Euro.  Is this &lit?  You tell me.  Confusingly, in French the Netherlands alone is referred to as *les Pays-Bas*, THE LOW COUNTRIES.  Or *La Hollande*.  But despite the fact that we (and indeed many Dutch people) call The Netherlands ‘Holland’, only two of the twelve provinces of *Le Royaume des Pays-Bas* are actually Holland.  Confusing, innit?  Sil van den Hoek is your man to explain it, if he drops in.

"
5506,Pair left in four-seater car,COUPLE,"Definition: Pair
Once I’d realised that there wasn’t a car called a DOUBE, this became obvious.  It’s L in COUPÉ.  Since it comes from the past participle of the French verb *couper*, ‘to cut’, I’d always thought it referred to a two-seater.  But a look online tells me that it can mean lots of different car types, and there doesn’t seem to be one particular definition.  So the setter is on firm ground.

anagram of HERE I AM;  My last in, and even then I had to check online to make sure that it was right.  Some online sources give it as two words – HAERE MAI – but since Phi lives in New Zealand, I think we can safely assume that this version is also acceptable.  It’s a Maori greeting, meaning ‘come hither’.  More sex.
"
5541,Most of Across anagrams getting award,OSCAR,"Definition: award
anagram of ACROS[S];  ‘Anagram’ can also be a verb.

An insertion of anagram of OSTLER; in HIES.
"

"
5558,Bob possibly getting call after controversial musical,HAIRSTYLE,"Definition: Bob possibly
A charade of HAIR for the ‘controversial musical’ and STYLE for ‘call’.  HAIR was controversial because the cast got their kit off in one scene (although personally I found the 1970s’ hairstyles more offensive).  STYLE in its verbal sense: ‘to style a man a fool’ is the example that my Collins gives.

An insertion of CE reversed in RITE.
"
5572,Number in charge not from South American university,PRINCETON,"Definition: American university

"
5585,Open University’s up-to-date welcoming lecturers?,UNSCREW,"Definition: Open
Well, I think this is U followed by SCR in NEW.  SCR in Oxbridge circles is Senior Common Room, and since this is a room reserved for postgraduates, then I suppose some of them could be ‘lecturers’.  Someone out there may have a better parsing.
"
5586,Coded language seen in unlooked-for translation,FORTRAN,"Definition: Coded language
Here’s a blast from the past.  Hidden in unlooked-FOR TRANSlation.  A computer coding language that I learned when I was at uni.  Which was a very long time ago.
"
5587,Ugly person‘s outburst about drunken orgy,GARGOYLE,"Definition: Ugly person
An insertion of RYGO, which is anagram of ORGY; in GALE.  I wouldn’t use GARGOYLE to describe an individual who was ugly, but the ones stuck at the top of buildings wouldn’t win any prizes for beauty.  GALE for ‘outburst’ as in GALE OF LAUGHTER.  On checking, I find my Collins has ‘a person with a grotesque appearance’, so the setter is on firm ground.
"
5588,Christian’s love showing disbelief,AGAPE,"Definition: Christian’s loveshowing disbelief
There were several types of love in Ancient Greece.  AGAPE (pronounced ‘a ga pay’) was unconditional love, almost of a charitable nature, which was associated with the early Christians.  EROS, on the other hand, was getting your leg over love.  It’s a dd.
"
5589,Joy embraces bishop in church property,GLEBE,"Definition:  church property
An insertion of B in GLEE.  ‘A piece of land serving as part of a clergyman’s benefice and providing income.’  If you’re a fan of *The* *Archers*, you’ll know that Glebe Cottage is one of the residences in Ambridge, presumably getting its name from this meaning.  What the hell does Elizabeth think she’s doing?
"
5590,Stops Susanna acquiring pass,SUSPENDS,"Definition: Stops
This appears to be an insertion of SPEND for ‘pass’ (time) in SUS.  Is SUS a shortened form of ‘Susanna’?

I think this is L and ARCH, but I can’t quite parse it.  Is the setter telling us to put L for ‘hand’ to the left of ARCH?
"
5595,Expert briefly returns books for formalist,PEDANT,"Definition: formalist
Kairos is asking you to reverse ADEPT, take off the last letter, then add NT for New Testament, or ‘books’ to give you a word that describes someone who likes everything to be tickety-boo and formally correct.  Never met a crossword fan who was a pedant.
"
5596,Innsbruck nervously entertains composer,BRUCKNER,"Definition: composer
Hidden in InnsBRUCK NERvously.  The hidden indicator is ‘entertains’.  The Austrian composer Anton BRUCKNER; and Innsbruck is in Austria, which gives an added dimension to the clue.
"
5597,Flippin’ Young Conservative animals in The Swan ,CYGNUS,"This is a reversal of YC for ‘Young Conservatives’ followed by GNUS.  But why Kairos chose to use “flippin'” as the reversal indicator rather than “flipping” I don’t rightly know.  It’s referring to the constellation CYGNUS, which comes from the Latin and is the root for our word CYGNET for a young swan.  Don’t argue with a swan: it’ll seriously damage you if you get in a fight.
"
5598,"Destroy Chester, say",DEVASTATE,"Definition: Destroy
DEVA was the Roman settlement that became Chester; so it’s DEVA and STATE.
"
5599,Lollard queen mounted by Eric?,IDLER,"Definition: Lollard

"
5600,Take in a means to worry,EAT AWAY,"Definition: worry
A charade of EAT for ‘take in’ or ingest and A WAY.
"
5601,Wacky baccy free in coffee shop,CYBERCAFE,"Definition: coffee shop
Brilliant surface and clue, conjuring up the coffee shops in Amsterdam.  anagram of BACCY FREE; with ‘wacky’ as the anagrind.  What some folk call a ‘lift and separate’ clue, since you have to disassociate ‘wacky’ from ‘baccy’.
"
5602,Private decapitated evildoer,INNER,"Definition: Private
[S]INNER.
"
5603,Religious group bottles many perfumes,ESSENCES,"Definition: perfumes
An insertion of C for one hundred or ‘many’ in ESSENES, the 2nd century BC Judaic sect.  Usually it’s D, five hundred, for ‘many’, but C works just as well.
"
5604,Sweet refined man kisses Mr Cummings,TOFFEE,"Definition: Sweet
A charade of TOFF for ‘refined man’ and EE for ee cummings, the American poet.  ‘Kisses’ is the hint to put the two together, like lips would do during osculation.

5605,One of two men maybe chants?,GREGORIAN,"Definition: chants
Another of my favourites today.  GREG OR IAN.
"
5606,Star graduate boards a modified lander,ALDEBARAN,"Definition: Star

"
5607,Mature adult leaving with new teenagers?,AGE GROUP,"Definition: teenagers
This baby took a bit of parsing: it’s AGE for ‘mature’ (as in cheese) then GRO[W][N]UP.  ‘Leaving’ is the removal indicator.
"
5608,Dictator of southern city in Estonia we hear,STALIN,"Definition: Dictator
A charade of S for ‘southern’ and TALIN, which is a homophone of TALLINN, the capital of Estonia.
"

A charade of SWAG and GER.  SWAG: ‘a curtain or piece of fabric fastened so as to hang in a drooping curve’. GER: ‘a Mongolian tent, also known as a yurt’.  So there you go.

"
5611,Remarkable denial of 1950’s teenager?  I’m ______ !,NOTED,"Definition: Remarkable
Well, if I’m a ROCKER, then I’m NO TED.  Referring to the gangs from the fifties.  Since I am a 29ac, I will point out that Kairos has got his apostrophe in the wrong place.  Since Mods and Rockers were from the 1950s, then it needs to be 1950s’ in the surface and not 1950’s, which would suggest that all the aggro finished on 31st December 1950.  And anyway, I fancy Mods and Rockers were more of a 1960s’ phenomenon.  I’ll stop being a 29ac now.
"
5612,Remains of local taken from country?,RELIC,"Definition: Remains
A country could be a REPUBLIC and if you do this – RE[PUB]LIC – what remains are, well, ‘remains’.
"
5613,Exist as extremely cold people who can’t agree?,BE POLES APART,"A cd, and despite having all the crossing letters, it was my last one in.  I got a bit wrong-footed because Quixote doesn’t often do cds.
"
5614,See naturalist want to restrict damage,LAMARCK,"Definition: See naturalist
An insertion of MAR in LACK.  Perhaps not the best-known naturalist, but I did know him.  Jean-Baptise LAMARCK (1744-1829) was what we would now call a ‘scientist’.  He was one of the first important thinkers about evolution, recognising that species did change over time.  But his hypothesis was that an animal could acquire characteristics during its lifetime, which would then be passed on to the next generation.  So giraffes’ necks got longer because they stretched up high to reach leaves; and they passed that on to their offspring.  It became discredited when Darwin proposed natural selection, where random mutations in DNA allow better adapted organisms to survive.  But hey, disproving previous hypotheses is how science works.
"
5615,Trudged as little pedestrian behind vehicle,TRAMPED,"Definition: Trudged
A charade of TRAM and PED.
"
5616,"A king is defeatist ultimately, taking external knock in the country",PAKISTAN,"Definition: the country
An insertion of A K IS and T for the last letter of ‘defeatist’ in PAN.
"
5617,Form of water’ would be about right,STREAM,"This works for me, but I’m not quite sure how to explain it.  STEAM is a ‘form of water’ and so is a STREAM.  Insert R into the former and you’ve got the latter.
"
5618,22 or 25 pounds,PONY,"Definition: 2225 pounds
The solution to 22 is GEE-GEE, and a PONY is certainly one of those.  It’s also a slang word for £25.  So a dd.
"
5619,"Motherly type grabs woman at match, a Scot",HEBRIDEAN,"Definition: Scot
In a muppet-like way, I stuck in HIBERNIAN without really thinking about it.  But of course it’s BRIDE for ‘woman at match’ and A in HEN for ‘motherly type’.  Good clue.
"
5620,Jazz fan engaged by certain record companies for shows,INDICATES,"Definition: shows
Another insertion: of CAT for ‘jazz fan’ in INDIES for ‘certain record companies’.  As in Indie labels.  As opposed to the Indy, which is where we are now.

A charade of OM for ‘Order of Merit’ and IT.
"
5622,"Boxer, for instance, showing goodness repeatedly",GEE,"Definition: Boxer, for instance
-GEEDespite having got PONY before I solved this clue, I was struggling to see how it worked, and it was only on coming to write up the blog that I had the pdm.  ‘Goodness!’ could be expressed in American English as GEE!  Two of those give you GEE-GEE.  Boxer?  He’s the loyal and hard-working cart-horse in George Orwell’s *Animal Farm*.  In  the end Napoleon and the other pigs say they are sending him to the veterinary surgeon; but in fact they send him to the knacker’s yard.  Life’s a bitch.  And then you die.
"
5623,"Country is sick, going backwards, old archdeacon admitted",SLOVENIA,"Definition: Country
An insertion of O VEN in a reversal of AILS.
"
5624,"Take it easy having had meal, say – not for the first time",RESTATE,"Definition: say – not for the first time
A charade of REST and ATE.

5625,Island where accountant may be spotted in The Dog and Duck,CURA,"Definition: Island
ÇAOAn insertion of ACA in CUR and O for a cricket ‘duck’.  ACA is Associate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants.  CURAÇAO is in the Dutch Antilles.

A charade of BUMP and KIN.
"
5628,"Examine foreign country, then one relatively prosperous region of ours",PERUSE,"Definition: Examine
A charade of PERU and SE.  The SE of the UK could certainly be described as a ‘relatively prosperous region’.  They should apply for independence.

anagram of I ASK HOTEL;
"
5630,Place offers something worth looking at according to report,SITE,"Definition: Place
A homophone (‘according to report’) of SIGHT.  Conjunctivis.com.  Now there’s a site for sore eyes.  © Tim Vine.
"
5631,It’s obvious insect can penetrate banana,PLANTAIN,"Definition: banana
An insertion of ANT in PLAIN.  A PLANTAIN is indeed a type of banana, but you wouldn’t want to eat it raw.  However, if you cook it, it can be used in a good number of recipes.  Banana’s etymology is interesting: it comes via Spanish and Portuguese from the Mande languages of West Africa.  Plantain is related to the Spanish *el plátano*.  Most European languages have a variation on ‘banana’: *une banane, een banaan, eine Banane, en banan*.  Seems like it’s only Spanish that has something different.
"
5632,"Full rent collected by agent, second quarter of the year",REPLETE,"Definition: Full
An insertion of LET for ‘rent’ in REP and E for the second letter of ‘year’.  Since it has four letters, E is the ‘second quarter’.
"
5633,"One animal in a thousand facing terrible peril, bound to be captured",KLIPSPRINGER,"Definition: One animal
I will fess up to having to use a wordsearch to get this.  I love natural history, but I’d never heard of this antelope before.  It’s a charade of K and SPRING in anagram of PERIL;  Which is obvious.  Once you know the answer.

5634,"Evil folk joining renegade, one emerging as anti-establishment figure?",DEMONSTRATOR,"Definition: anti-establishment figure
A charade of DEMONS and TRA[I]TOR.

PRY making its second appearance this morning.  Here you have to insert OX into it.
"
5650,Period in which terrible storm affected athlete,SPORTSMAN,"Definition: athlete
This appears to be anagram of STORM; in SPAN, but if we take ‘terrible’ as the anagrind, then I can’t see what ‘affected’ is doing in the clue.

anagram of IS A TRAP I;

5652,Flash dash!,STREAK,"Definition: Flashdash
A dd.

5653,It’s about mannequin going first to get changed,REMODELLED,"Definition: changed

5769,Tone set by report of collier alongside jetty,MINOR KEY,"Definition: Tone set
A homophone of ‘miner’ and ‘quay’.  I’m not entirely sure that I’d describe a MINOR KEY as a ‘tone’, so perhaps the definition is ‘tone set’, which would be what music in a MINOR KEY would do.  Minor chords including a flattened third sound sad.  Or that could be cobblers.

Really good concise clue.  ROCKS TAR.
"
5779,Genuine stunner’s quite heartless,KOSHER,"Definition: Genuine
Once I got some crossers, I was able to guess the answer, but it took a while to parse.  I think, and only think, that it’s KOSH for ‘stunner’; that the apostrophe s should be read as ‘has’ and that ‘quite heartless’ is [V]ER[Y].  If I’m right, then this clue is a bit too intricate for the IoS; if I’m wrong, then some kind soul will no doubt parse it for me.
"
5780,Opener has to hit cross heavenward,DOORKNOB,"Definition: Opener
Since it’s a down clue, ‘heavenward’ is the reversal indicator.  So it’s BONK and ROOD reversed.  BONK (in one of its meanings at least) means ‘hit’ and ROOD is derived from the Old English word for ‘cross’.  As in HOLYROOD, in Edinburgh, which means ‘holy cross’.

anagram of SOME DEBS;
"
5787,Stagger from Birmingham area?!,ASTONISH,"Definition: Stagger
The double punctuation marks at the end suggest that this is extremely whimsical.  ASTON is an area of Birmingham (it has a university and a football team), so you might say that if you came from ASTON, then you’d be ASTON-ISH.  And ASTONISH means to ‘stagger’.  You didn’t like this one?  Move on.  I thought it was funny, but I did say a bad word when I finally got it.

Since it’s a down clue, it’s RAY under A ST.
"
5791,Maybe bro returns clutching bit of greens on credit – it’s worse than carrot!,BIG STICK,"Definition: it’s worse than carrot
Thank you, Mr Setter – if you’re going to give us a clue that’s hard to solve and parse, just stick it in at 1 Across, why don’t you?  Then solvers like me who have to start with the first across clue because otherwise the universe will implode can spend inordinate amounts of time trying to get it before becoming frustrated and moving on to the next across clue.  It’s an insertion of G for ‘bit of greens’ in BIS for ‘maybe bro’ or SIB reversed, followed by TICK for ‘credit’.  Not my favourite ever Crosophile clue, but we’ll move on.
"
5792,"Yes, a machine for removing beards – he might well gape",YAWNER,"Definition: he might well gape
A charade of Y and AWNER.  The latter is not in my edition of Collins, but online dictionaries give it as ‘a machine for removing awns from grain’.  And since AWNS are the bristles growing from the spikelets of grains, you could say that it removes ‘beards’.
"
5793,"Salon, say, that’s rather snotty?",RHEUM,"Definition: rather snotty
A ‘salon’ is a room, which is a homophone of RHEUM, another word for snot.

I think this is a charade of L, URG[E] and I, but I’m not entirely sure how the clue is telling us to get there.  I’d always spell it LURGY, and that’s the only option that my Collins gives.
"
5797,Gaping like a tourist seeing amorous kissing behind section of bridge,RUBBERNECKING,"Definition: Gaping like a tourist
Crosophile’s definition is spot on, but the term is probably used more often these days to describe motorway drivers slowing down to have a butcher’s at the accident in the opposite carriageway, thus causing tailbacks in both directions.  A charade of RUBBER (a part of ‘bridge’, the card game) and NECKING, which is a slightly old-fashioned term for ‘kissing’.  What you did as a teenage boy before you got into a top-half only fumble, if I remember well.
"
5798,"In addition, we have 3 (not quite right) with taking away from 2",THERETO,"Definition: In addition
My Collins marks the ‘in addition’ meaning as ‘obsolete’.  I think it’s THREE with the R moved forward to make THERE, followed by T[W]O.
"
5799,Money we handed over for a tasty snack perhaps,CASHEW,"Definition: a tasty snack perhaps
A charade of CASH and WE reversed.  CASHEWS could certainly be considered a snack, but whether you find them tasty or not is clearly a matter of personal preference.

"
5814,Group of academics – they’re able to articulate,TENDONS,"Definition: they’re able to articulate
A group of academics, whimsically, could be TEN DONS.  But since TENDONS attach muscles to bone (like the Achilles tendon), I’m not sure that tendons could be said to ‘articulate’.  Bones do, certainly, but not tendons.

5815,It’s unusual in makeover to render home improvements but about time,ODDITY,"Definition: It’s unusual
This puzzle has taken a bit of parsing.  A reversal of DO for ‘render’ and then T in DIY.  I think.

"
5827,"Betrayals come from unbeliever, it is said",INFIDELITIES,"Definition: Betrayals
I hope I’m wrong in parsing this as INFIDEL and a homophone of ‘it is’, because the only way I can make that work is to put on a broad Brummie accent when saying ‘it is’.  Cue homophone debate.

You need to change L and R (‘hands’) in MORAL.
"
5839,Rear section of orchestra might not be seen to start immediately,STRAIGHT,"It’s – I think – a charade of [ORCHE]STRA and [M]IGHT.  Some folk won’t like this, because there’s no indication of how much the ‘rear section’ of ‘orchestra’ is; and I can’t think of a sentence where I’d substitute STRAIGHT for ‘immediately’.  STRAIGHT AWAY, fine.
"

A charade of D, ESC for the first letters of ‘essential service contract’ and ENDS.

"
5843,Give out drugs for heartless disease gripping writers,DISPENSE,"Definition: Give out drugs

5856,"We, entertained by young socialites? They’re socially inept!",DWEEBS,"Definition: They’re socially inept
An insertion of WE in DEBS.  It’s American rather than British English and crops up in crosswords more often than it ought to; perhaps not much else fits this pattern.  What we on this side of the pond would call NERDS.

"
5860,"Appropriate to grieve over, say, a large sea creature",RIGHT WHALE,"Definition: a large sea creature
I got the WHALE bit before I got RIGHT, and then had to check.  Three species of large baleen whales of the genus Eubalaena: the North Atlantic, the North Pacific and the Southern.  So it’s right for ‘appropriate’ and WHALE, which is a homophone of WAIL for ‘to grieve over’.

5865,"Mourn a VIP, a remarkable Finnish runner",PAAVO NURMI,"Definition: Finnish runner
In defence of this clue, it’s an obvious anagram anagram of ‘remarkable’) of (MOURN A VIP A;.  However, even with all the crossing letters, it’s not a write-in because it’s a foreign name.  He was known as ‘The Flying Finn’, but died in 1973, so unless you’re into athletics, you might have struggled.

"
5898,He’s standing to welcome two women into small boat that’s not on the level,SKEW WHIFF,"Definition: that’s not on the level

A homophone of BOILS for ‘cooks’ and LAW for ‘teaching’.  For a fixed amount of gas kept at a fixed temperature, pressure and volume are inversely proportional.  *PV = k*, if you remember your chemistry.  Named after Robert Boyle.  And the law explains why, when the phlebotomist pulls back the plunger on the syringe, the precious red stuff makes its way into the chamber.  Although if you’re like me, you are looking the other way when this procedure takes place.

5906,Song boasted about members of SAS?,AIRCREW,"Definition: members of SAS

"
5912,Barchester chaplain cycles and runs,LOPES,"Definition: runs
I’m not quite going to ask Kairos to confess his sins for this one, but it’s a bit obscure.  You have to be familiar with Trollope’s *Barchester Towers*, in which there is a character called Obadiah SLOPE, who is the chaplain.  If you ‘cycle’ that, you get LOPES.  Did I have to look the character up on t’internet?  Er, yes …  Were you doing the puzzle on the commute with no access to the internet?  Then I rest my case.

"
5916,Tin with cobalt plating found on number one toy,MECCANO,"Definition: toy
There’s been some clever cluing in this puzzle.  The ‘tin’ is CAN; Kairos is asking you to ‘coat’ it in CO, which is the chemical symbol for ‘cobalt’, and then put it behind ME, who is ‘number one’ in the sense of ‘looking after number one’.  Nothing to do with wee.
"

"
5925,Stomach what Le Pétomane did endlessly?,GASTRIC,"Definition: Stomach
This made me smile when I got it.  I did know who *Le Pétomane* was: he was famous in the late 1800s as a flatulist, farting to play or accompany tunes.  (Sorry if that’s not what you wanted to read on a Monday morning, but I didn’t write the clue.)  So it’s GAS TRIC[K].  For those of you out there called Peter, I’m afraid that the French for ‘fart’ is *péter*, whence his name.
"
5926,What King George VI presumably did for Sir Henry Cecil?,TRAINER,"Definition: Sir Henry Cecil?
I’m not privy to what goes on in the House of Windsor, put ‘presumably’ George VI, Brenda’s father, did TRAIN ER, *Elizabeth Regina*.  Sir Henry Cecil was a racehorse trainer, and the King George VI stakes is a horse race, apparently, so there’s an extra element to the clue.
"
5927,Prepare retrospective broadcast for 19:31?,PRIME TIME,"Definition: 19:31?
Another clue I especially liked.  A charade of PRIME for ‘prepare’ and a reversal of EMIT for ‘broadcast’.  And I guess programmes on the telly that start after 19:30 are PRIME TIME television.

"
5933,Slobbish house member involved in topless spree,UNKEMPT,"Definition: Slobbish
Not the kind of flatmate you’d want.  It’s MP for ‘house member’ in [J]UNKET, and it’s one of those words that doesn’t have a ‘positive’ equivalent.  You can be UNKEMPT, but you can’t be KEMPT.  There are other examples, but I can’t remember any at the minute because parsing this crossword has frazzled what passes for my brain.
"
5934,Food in South American state,SUSHI,"Definition: Food
A charade of S, US and HI.  This time you do have to think the US state: HI is the zip code abbreviation for the state of Hawaii.

5936,"M, Alfie, ET and Surf’s Up, say? ",FEATURE FILMS,"Definition: M, Alfie, ET and Surf’s Up, say
A clever anagram to start us off.  anagram of M, ALFIE, ET SURF; with ‘ is up’ as the anagrind, and the whole clue is the definition.  So it’s &lit.  And the italicised bits are indeed all films.  *Alfie* was one of Michael Caine’s early successes.
"

A charade of BUFFET, IN and G.
"
5938,Bet on turning over joker first,WAGER,"Definition: Bet

The clue does what it says on the tin: reverse THINK and insert G into it.
"
5947,"Belch leads to ravening, unpleasant creature appearing in Alien ",ERUCT,"Definition: Belch
My favourite today: RUC for the first letters of ‘ravening, unpleasant creature’ in ET.  And it’s an ‘extended definition’ clue, because it’s referring to the classic scene in *Alien* where John Hurt’s character starts to belch at the dinner table, and the creature explodes out of his stomach.  The director used pig’s blood in the effect without telling the other actors about it, which is why they all look genuinely frightened.  Done in one take.
"
5948,"Lean on sticky, unknown object",THINGUMMY,"Definition: unknown object
A charade of THIN and GUMMY.  Good clue.
"
5949,Arrange journey by sea around island – it’s easy,PLAIN SAILING,"Definition: easy

An insertion of FEE in EN for ‘enrolled nurse’ and BLED.  It used to be (and still is in some crosswords) SEN for ‘State Enrolled Nurse’, but now the NHS is being slowly privatised and state involvement is on the wane, this seems to be the preferred abbreviation.

Hidden in looSE GUErnsey.
"
5956,Reasonably cleverly made knickknack,PRETTY,"Definition: knickknack
-PRETTYTook a bit of a furtle in the dictionary to explain this one.  PRETTY-PRETTY as a definition of ‘knickknack’ is not in my Collins, but is in my SOED.  ‘Reasonably’ for PRETTY is straightforward: ‘this clue was pretty/reasonably easy to solve’.  The ‘cleverly’ definition is marked in the SOED as only a 17th century usage.  Anyway, I think that’s what this is all about.
"
5957,This may indicate a late sherry got drunk after opening of brandy!,BREATHALYSER,"Definition: This may indicate a late sherry got drunk after opening of brandy
A charade of B and anagram of A LATE SHERRY;, with an &littishness about the clue.  Or perhaps it is &lit.  The anagrind is ‘got drunk’.

"
5972,Temporary coach directed first person further back,TRANSIENT,"Definition: Temporary
Well, ‘coach directed’ would be TRAIN SENT; then if you change the position (‘further back’) of I, which is the ‘first person’ grammatically, you get TRANSIENT.  But for me, since we write from left to right and this is an across clue, this is putting I further forward.  Or perhaps I’m just being a bit dense this morning.
"
5973,Indian bread and water passed after game,RUPEE,"Definition: Indian bread
A charade of RU for the setters’ favourite ‘game’, and … well, you can work it out, I’m sure.  ‘Bread’ in the ‘money’ sense.

A dd.
"
5991,"Benefits from book by novelist, Doris’s last",BLESSINGS,"Definition: Benefits
First one attempted; last one in.  But it is a teasing clue: Everyman, in a roundabout way, is prompting you to think of a novelist called Doris.  That’d be DORIS LESSING.  Then it’s B for ‘book’, LESSING, and S for the last letter of ‘Doris’.  Liked this one.  The 2007 winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, and a great author.
"
5992,Shoot bishop after all others,BLAST,"Definition: Shoot

6007,Groucho’s Bar playing show song,SCARBOROUGH FAIR,"anagram of GROUCHOS BAR; with ‘playing’ as the anagrind followed by FAIR for ‘show’.  Made famous by Simon and Garfunkel’s *Scarborough Fair/Canticle*, but it’s in fact a traditional English folk song which Simon learned from Martin Carthy.   It’s all about contradictions.  And the S&G version featured on *The Graduate*, which made Dustin Hoffman famous and whose director, Mike Nichols, died last week. Brill film.
"
6008,"Turning brown – Russian river, as is to be expected",NATURAL,"Definition: as is to be expected

A charade of COT and ERIE.
"
6017,"Girl, one interrupting queen",ANNIE,"Definition: Girl
Not my favourite kind of clue, since ‘girl’ could be a squillion things.  But it’s I in ANNE, who was indeed a Queen.  Any road up, no orphans were harmed in the writing of this clue.

Hidden in hoUSE Democrats.
"
6019,Promote shoe from East so plugging slogan,BACK TO BASICS,"Definition: slogan
Well, if you’re going to give us a complicated one, Mr Setter, then let’s get it out of the way at 1 across.  This is – I think – BACK for ‘promote’ followed by SIC for ‘so’ in a reversal (‘from East’) of SABOT for ‘shoe’.  I seem to remember that John Major’s Tory government of the 1990s had this as a slogan to promote family values.  And then it turned out that he was shagging Edwina Curry.

It took me the longest time to see what was going on here.  As usual with Raich, it’s precisely clued.  It’s anagram of RELIC; in S for the last letter of ‘godless’ and AGE.  And it’s &lit, since the whole clue leads to the answer.

"
6037,Southern ranch finally productive can be split,SHARABLE,"Definition: can be split
A charade of S, H for the last letter of ‘ranch’ and ARABLE.  I think I’d spell this SHAREABLE, but this is no doubt given as an alternative.  Let’s not go there, otherwise we’ll be having a long and ultimately fruitless debate about whether it’s CLUING or CLUEING.
"
6038,Fashionable range in yellow,CHICKEN,"Definition: yellow
A charade of CHIC and KEN.  KEN as in ‘beyond my ken’, I guess.
"

"
6047,Student meets someone adrift without friends in LA?,LONESOME,"Definition: without friends in LA
A charade of L for learner or ‘student’ and anagram of SOMEONE;  I think Provis has put the ‘in LA’ bit there because this is more an American English than British English adjective.  Are you lonesome tonight?

A charade of E, GO, IS and M for the first letter of ‘modify’.
"
6049,Vegetarians may eat this fruit bake,NUT ROAST,"Definition: Vegetarians may eat this

6063,Wrecked without a topsail at sea,SPOILT,"Definition: Wrecked

"
6066,"Bottom part of drain fell in river, creating an obstruction",IN THE WAY,"Definition: an obstruction
Well, maybe a bit convoluted for a Quiptic.  The bottom part of ‘drain’ is IN (but how much of its bottom do you want me to pinch?), then you need HEW for ‘fell’ in the River TAY.

MUTE D is the ‘dumb democrat’; you need to insert IN and I in that.

6075,Banish farm vehicles back across French/Belgian river?  On the contrary,OSTRACISE,"Definition: Banish

It’s – I think – VI for ‘six’, TAL[E]S for ‘non-English stories’, TATI for ‘director’ (referring to Jacques Tati), T for the first letter of ‘translated’ in SICS for a homophone of ‘six’.   They ideally used to be 36-24-36, but it’s probably gone metric now.

6082,Runner by chorister forgetting Queen hit,OSTRICH,"Definition: Runner
If you leave out ER for ‘Queen’ from ‘chorister’ then you get anagram of CHORIST; which gives you an anagram of OSTRICH, which you could certainly describe, in the broadest sense of the word, as a ‘runner’.  The surface is not putting a picture in my head.  The anagrind is ‘hit’.
"
6083,See article on duck eggs,OVA,"Definition: eggs
A charade of V for ‘see’ and A for ‘article’ following O for ‘duck’ in its cricketing sense.  V – if I remember well – stands for the Latin *vide*, which is the imperative of the verb ‘to see’.  A Latin scholar out there can correct me if I’m wrong.  It refers a reader to another entry in a dictionary, for example.
"
6084,"Layer of skin from duck, punctured by power spray briefly",EPIDERMIS,"Definition: Layer of skin
The duck (non-cricketing this time) is the EIDER: you need to insert P for ‘power’ in that and then follow it with MIS[T].  There is no obligatory Pierre bird link because the duck is not the solution.  It is a handsome bird, though, and responsible for EIDERDOWNS.
"
6085,Marrow’s essential content for bones,RADII,"Definition: bones
This is getting a bit convoluted for my liking.  It’s clever, though, and a good surface.  The ‘essential content’ of ‘maRRow’ is two Rs .  In mathematical terms the abbreviation for ‘radius’, half the diameter of a circle: area of circle = Pi r² and all that.  But in anatomical terms they are the bones in your arm that run alongside the ulnae, which is what Hob is getting at.
"
6086,Loner?  Perhaps Napoleon I’s tendency at first,SOLOIST,"Definition: Loner
Not your French General, but your *Man from U.N.C.L.E.*  So if you are a young person, you will have had no idea about this, because the programme was very popular in the 1960s.  Napoleon SOLO plus I plus S plus T for the first letter of ‘tendency’.
"
6087,Get off!  Turn me over!  Get back on!,REMOUNT,"Definition: Get back on

"
6092,Secretary girl’s dish,PAELLA,"Definition: dish
A charade of PA for ‘personal assistant’ and ELLA.  Don’t overcook the rice; still needs to be nice and moist when served up.

Cross-referencing clues and referencing modern music: unusual for Everyman.  Too much Christmas sherry, perhaps?  The group CAST made an album in 1995 called ALL CHANGE and if you arrived at 19 across, then you’d get the call ALL CHANGE, because the train is nestled against the buffers and there’s nowhere else to go.  A dd.

BRIDE plus WELL.  BRIDEWELL was a prison established in London in 1553 for the purpose of ‘the punishment of the disorderly poor and the housing of homeless children’.  The 1553 bit could be why the setter has chosen the old-fashioned spelling: GAOL rather than JAIL.  I think the Guardian/Observer style guide recommends the latter.

A charade of SIDES and ADDLE.

"
6180,Sporting arena with the ultimate in football on display inside?,WHITE HART LANE,"Definition: Sporting arena with the ultimate in football on display inside?
anagram of ARENA WITH THE; around (‘on display inside’) L for the last letter of ‘football’.  I always had Everyman down as a golfing fan, so perhaps it’s the disappointment of Rory McIlroy not winning Sports Personality of the Year that has led him to giving us two football clues in one crossword.  And this is something you hardly ever see in an Everyman crossword: an &lit clue, where the whole clue defines the answer as well as there being a cryptic definition.  If you’re a Spurs fan, I suppose, which is why there might be a question mark at the end.  Tottenham Hotspur play at WHITE HART LANE.  For the minute.
"
6181,Understands about Italian boxer and medicinal drug,DIGITALIS,"Definition: medicinal drug
An insertion of IT and ALI in DIGS.  Comes from foxgloves, I think.  At the time of writing, Mohammed Ali was unwell.

anagram of LIT UP;
"
6197,"Keep young primarily when life begins, they say",FORTY,"Definition: when life begins, they say
A charade of FORT and Y for the first letter of ‘primarily’.  Because life begins at forty.  Which is balls.
"
6198,"It can’t hold 3, or 2s before 3",TWO,"Definition: It can’t hold 3
-SEATERLike my old MG Midget, a TWO-SEATER can’t hold three people.  It’s TWOS before EATER, which is an American English synonym for DINER, the solution to 3dn.

This is anagram of FAT TRIO; in two letter Ts.  Which you would ‘say’ as ‘Tees’.
"
6208,Elderly impressionist turning up shortly,AGED,"Definition: Elderly

Following on from 11ac, this is anagram of REACT; with ‘badly’ as the anagrind.  For once the ellipses can’t be ignored, but – given that I have explained it correctly – I don’t like it much.  Too convoluted.

A charade of BA for chemical element number 56, and (common) SALT, which indeed is a compound of sodium and chlorine, with the formula NaCl.  And BASALT is an igneous rock which comes from VOLCANOES, which is clued in 2dn.  That’s enough chemistry for one clue.
"
6226,Unlikely gadget,REMOTE,"Definition: Unlikelygadget

This is A RAD in POX, and I assume it’s referring to the surface reading in 3dn rather than the solution.

6228,Joint with hot seasoning,CUMIN,"Definition: seasoning
CUM is the Latin word for ‘with’, which could be used to express ‘joint’ if I say that a clue is a ‘cd cum dd’, I suppose.  And IN is ‘hot’ in the sense of ‘popular’.  So it’s a charade.  Cumin seasons carrots beautifully.
"
6229,Virtually a piece apart apiece,PER CAPITA,"Definition: apiece
The surface is meaningless, which is not a good start.  And I’m not sure what the setter is getting at, apart from the fact that anagram of A PIECE APART; with A and E left out gives you the answer.  But if ‘virtually’ is telling us to leave out those two letters, then where is the anagrind?  Some kind soul is going to have to explain this one.
"
6230,Container ship on river with Jack in New York,PENNILESS,"Definition: with Jack in New York
This is PEN for ‘container’, NILE and SS, but I’m not convinced by the definition.  The ‘in New York’ bit is presumably telling us that it’s American English, but I’ve only ever heard ‘jack all’, or less elegantly, ‘jack shit’ for a definition of ‘nothing’.

"
6237,I go up a hill following short French student,ELEVATOR,"Definition: I go up
A charade of ELEV[E] and A TOR.  Strictly, *élève* is French for ‘pupil’, but ‘student’ just about works, since ‘pupils’ is getting a bit old-fashioned these days.

I only know from crosswords rather than personal experience that ‘Tom’ is a slang word for ‘prostitute’ or PRO.  Then it’s NOUNCED.  Which is POUNCED taking out P for ‘President’ and replacing it with N for the first letter of ‘Neocons’.  A bit too convoluted for my liking.

A charade of L and LAMAS.  As in Dalai LAMA.
"
6409,"Sunglasses in lavender, lilac, magnolia etc",SHADES,"Definition: Sunglasses
Lavender, lilac and magnolia are SHADES, innit?  Although I should tell you that magnolia these days is called bamboo white, just to stop you embarrassing yourself in the local paint shop.  I won’t mention ‘Grey’, since the mummy-porn flick has been absolutely slagged off by the critics in this weekend’s papers.
"
6410,Naughty Nineties physicist,EINSTEIN,"Definition: physicist
anagram of NINETIES;  If you really are a beginner using the Quiptic to learn about the dark arts, then put this one in long-term memory, because you’ll see it again, I can assure you.

A dd.  STIR and ‘jug’ are both slang words for ‘prison’.

6454,Playing organ may cause complaint,GROAN,"Definition: complaint
anagram of ORGAN;
"
6455,"Priest’s consumed by ale, so moving thus?",ASLOPE,"Definition: Priest’s consumed by ale, so moving thus
An insertion of P for ‘priest’ in anagram of ALE SO;  My SOED gives for ASLOPE ‘inclined, sloping, crosswise, aslant’, so I guess it’s semi-&lit because the priest would be drunk.  But wouldn’t the ale be consumed by the priest to give this outcome?  I don’t like this much.
"
6456,Liked dad with full hair regularly trimmed,POPULAR,"Definition: Liked
A charade of POP and the even letters of fUlL hAiR.
"
6457,"Somewhere in Africa a bag’s returned comparatively empty, we hear",CASABLANCA,"Definition: Somewhere in Africa

VIOL[ENT]  ENT for ‘Ear, Nose and Throat’.
"
6459,Unstable boy knocked back a sort of jelly,ROCKY,"Definition: Unstable
This is my best stab at this, and those of a sensitive disposition should look away now.  It’s a reversal (‘knocked back’) of COR! for BOY! (synonymous exclamations) and KY for ‘a sort of jelly’.  KY JELLY is most commonly used as a vaginal lubricant to aid comfortable sexual intercourse.  I did tell you to look away.
"
6460,"Wipers on the Renault, front only, beset by problems",SNOTRAGS,"Definition: Wipers
This is an insertion of OTR in SNAGS.  But since two clues already have slightly irked me, I will say that OTR would need ‘fronts only’, which would completely screw up the surface reading.  But what do I know about cryptic grammar?  I’m a humble blogger.
"
6461,"Travelling west, briefly film mating jumbo",TITANIC,"Definition: jumbo
A reversal of CIN[E] and AT IT for having sex or ‘mating’.  The reversal indicator is ‘travelling west’.  Are CINE and ‘film’ synonymous?  Or is it CIN[EMA]?  Whatever, let’s hope the mating (female) jumbo had access to the KY Jelly, because a bull elephant is big in every sense.
"
6462,What jay is to jump first?,INITIAL,"Definition: What jay is to jumpfirst
The bird is the ‘jay’, but you’re not having an obligatory Pierre bird link because it’s not the solution.  J is the INITIAL letter of ‘jump’.  But I don’t like setters using random homophones like JAY to clue single letters.  I’m not liking this puzzle much so far, am I?  It’s a dd.
"
6463,Con man replicated the ad misleadingly,TED HEATH,"Definition: Con man
I liked this.  anagram of THE THE AD; for our sailing, conducting Conservative PM from the 1970s.
"

"
6466,Does salt enhance this ropey game?,DECK QUOITS,"Definition: ropey game
Nice surface, but it’s a bit of a weak cd, imho.  DECK QUOITS is played on board ships, so a ‘salt’ might enhance it, I suppose.
"
6467,Old brass name seen on bog discovered in gorge,PFENNIG,"Definition: Old brass
The PFENNIG was one hundredth of an old German Mark, so ‘old brass’.  It FEN and N in PIG for ‘gorge’.
"
6468,Former newsman joining artist where Classical debate held,EXEDRA,"Definition: where Classical debate held
A charade of EX, ED and RA.  My SOED is getting a bit of wear and tear this morning.  ‘Classical History: a hall or arcade with seats, attached to a palestra or a private house and used for conversation.’  I so knew that.
"
6469,"Exotic grub‘s on the house air-conditioning, they inform",FOCACCIA,"Definition: Exotic grub
A charade of FOC for free of charge or ‘on the house’, AC and CIA, who ‘inform’.  Most folk (especially in Islington and Hampstead) wouldn’t describe FOCACCIA as ‘exotic’, but the setter’s using the word in the sense of ‘foreign’, so fair play.
"
6470,First signs of mustiness?  Empty drawers and line with potpourri,MEDLEY,"Definition: potpourri
This works for me: the first ‘signs’ (plural) of Mustiness, Empty and Drawers followed by a LEY line.
"
6471,Son having roast damaged his tongue,SPANISH,"Definition: tongue
A charade of S, PAN and anagram of HIS;
"
6472,Duck pate’s made with this TV cook,OLIVER,"Definition: TV cook
Referring to Jamie Oliver. It’s O plus LIVER, because pâté – including duck pâté – can be made with liver.  But since the surface reading of the clue would have been much better if the accents had been included, I just wonder why the setter gave us ‘pate’.  Perhaps to misdirect us into thinking of ‘head’.  Which is certainly where I was for a good while.
"
6473,Ancient ship earlier patrolled river,ARGO,"Definition: Ancient ship
An insertion of R in AGO for Jason’s ship.
"
6474,Wisteria’s spreading by steps,STAIRWISE,"Definition: by steps
anagram of WISTERIAS;  Is STAIRWISE a word?  Not one I’d ever use.
"

An insertion of TO O in PLAN.  ‘Nailed’ as an insertion indicator?
"
6476,Extremely graceful backward roll by woman wrestler?,GLADIATOR,"Definition: wrestler
A charade of GL for the outside letters (‘extremely’) of ‘graceful’ plus a reversal (‘backward’) of ROTA IDA.  ‘Convoluted for a daily cryptic’ comes to mind.
"
6477,"With constant and close interaction, start to instruct relative with racket",IN,"Definition: With constant and close interaction
-AND-INThis crossword is still not growing on me.  BY-AND-BY, perhaps?  ON-AND-ON more likely.  No, it’s IN-AND-IN.  ‘Designating breeding within a limited stock; intimate and exclusive breeding’ (SOED).  It’s I for the first letter of ‘instruct’, NAN and DIN.
"
6478,"Male singer gets award, judge captivated by vocal qualities",TOM JONES,"Definition: Male singer
This is a good clue by anyone’s standards.  The ‘award’ is OM or Order of Merit, J is ‘judge’; you need to insert them in TONES for ‘vocal qualities’.  Do female fans of the Welsh crooner still take off their knickers and throw them at him when he’s on stage?  I think we should be told.
"
6479,Marathon character about to try US 26-miler here,CHICAGO,"Definition: US 26-miler here
This is ask the audience time, I’m afraid.  CHICAGO is of course a US venue for a marathon; and GO is a ‘try’.  Beyond that, I am discombobulated.  Chico from the Marx brothers?  No, thought not.  In fact, on giving the blog a final check, I think I have it.  CHI for the Greek letter (‘marathon character’), CA for ‘circa’ or ‘about’ and GO for ‘try’.
"
6480,Joint allowed a little settlement,HAMLET,"Definition: a little settlement
A charade of HAM and LET.
"
6481,Trifle that Parisian wanted in place of kippers,COQUET,"Definition: Trifle
An insertion of QUE for one of the French words for ‘that’ (*Je crois que c’est important*/I think that it’s important) in COT, which is where young ‘kippers’ would go bye-byes.  I’m more familiar with COQUETTE, the female version; but my SOED gives COQUET as a verb: ‘to dally, trifle or toy (with)’.
"
6482,"I’ve done wrong surgery, cutting into bone",OOPS,"Definition: I’ve done wrong
Well, I got it without much conviction, because it could only be OP in OS and I knew that OS was French for ‘bone’  (which has given us OSSIFY, OSTEOPOROSIS, and much else).  OS for ‘bone’ is in my SOED (you’re getting bored with this now, I know) but ‘only as a modifier in Latin names of particular bones’.  Like OS PENIS, the bone of the penis found in many mammals.  But not humans.  Which is perhaps why we need KY Jelly.
"
6483,A group on leave,ABANDON,"Definition: leave
A charade of A, BAND and ON.
"
6484,Cried during infected pus being cleaned,SWEPT UP,"Definition: cleaned
Lovely surface reading, thank you, Provis.  An insertion of WEPT in anagram of PUS;
"
6485,Gather in front section of harlequin garment,HARVEST,"Definition: Gather
It’s a charade of HAR for the ‘front section of harlequin’ and VEST for ‘garment’.  Cue complaints from folk who don’t like ‘front section’ indicating the first three (how many, exactly?) letters of a word.  I am undecided about this technique, although I did get the solution reasonably quickly, so can’t complain too much.
"
6486,Report of a hundred in number,ACCOUNT,"Definition: Report
An insertion of C in A COUNT.
"
6487,Opt for spoken language test for those entitled to vote,ELECTORAL,"Definition: for those entitled to vote

Hidden in mEN DO Well.
"
6490,"Due to ANC, I abandoned schooling",EDUCATION,"Definition: schooling
anagram of DUE TO ANC I; although those interested in South African politics would no doubt disagree with the surface.
"
6491,Sacked second ancient city captured in heroic exploit,DESTROYED,"Definition: Sacked
An insertion of  S TROY in DEED.
"
6492,Die in agony by court order,EDICT,"Definition: order
anagram of DIE; plus CT.
"
6493,Demonstration starting from Marble Arch,MARCH,"Definition: Demonstration
Well, it’s a Quiptic, and it should be simple: it’s M plus ARCH.
"
6494,"Ice mostly goes with drink containing gin, say",ALCOHOLIC,"Definition: containing gin, say
A charade of ALCOHOL and IC[E].  Nice surface.
"
6495,Most difficult of everything in the exam,TALLEST,"Definition: Most difficult

"
6497,Detective almost half suspects journalist is no longer working,DISUSED,"Definition: no longer working
Here we go again with ‘how many letters do you want me to remove?’  It’s DI, SUS[PECTS] plus ED.
"
6498,Exhibition to show contempt for freedom of movement,DISPLAY,"Definition: Exhibition
It’s a charade of DIS and PLAY, but I would write ‘show contempt for’ as DISS.  ‘Don’t diss me.’  But I’m not of that generation, so I could be wrong.
"
6499,A child that is initially very eager to win,ACHIEVE,"Definition: win
A charade of A, CH, IE and VE for the first letters of ‘very eager’.
"
6500,Idiot in charge of the RAF?,AIRHEAD,"Definition: Idiot
A cd, suggesting that the person that is ‘in charge of the RAF’ would be an AIR HEAD.

6501,Remained blue over ending of employment,DWELT,"Definition: Remained
A reversal of LEWD followed by T for the last letter of ’employment’.

A charade of NO, TO, RIET (a homophone of RIOT) and Y for the first letter of ‘Yemeni’.
"
6503,Cut out delay,STALL,"Definition: Cut outdelay
A dd.  Referring to aeroplanes (the consequences are not good) and putting back (which sometimes can be good).
"
6504,Urge limits to exaggeration about how old we are,ENCOURAGE,"Definition: Urge
The outside letters of ‘exaggeration’ followed by C for circa or ‘about’ followed by OUR AGE.  Which in my case, is seriously old.
"
6505,Wave in Thailand capsized one man beside you and me,TSUNAMI,"Definition: Wave
A good surface reading, which it took me some time to decipher.  It’s T for ‘Thailand’ followed by a reversal of I, MAN and US.
"
6506,Order to touch bird gently,PATTERN,"If you touched a tern gently, then you’d PAT TERN.
"
6507,It’s of no use to throw out a smaller quantity,WORTHLESS,"Definition: It’s of no use

anagram of DUNDEE CID;
"

6510,Surfboarder’s opening advantage is more than needed,SURPLUS,"Definition: more than needed
Here we go again. I think it’s SUR plus PLUS.

A charade of I’LL, EG and AL[L].
"
6512,Old soldiers voluntarily left in the centre of London without specific agreement,TACITLY,"Definition: without specific agreement
A charade of TA and L in CITY.  It’s ‘old’ because the TA are now called something else, which I can’t at the minute remember.
"
6513,Bill and Edward played their part,ACTED,"Definition: played their part
A charade of ACT and ED
"
6514,That man’s holding a record for domestics,HELPS,"Definition: domestics
An insertion of LP in HE’S.
"
6515,"Kitchen surface perhaps, useful to prophet taking heroin …",FORMICA,"Definition: Kitchen surface perhaps
MICAH was an Old Testament prophet, so if you take (away) H from that you’ve got MICA, then you need FOR to precede that.
"
6516,"E.g. Gandhi, taking half of heroin etc through biro",BIOPIC,"Definition: E.g. Gandhi
I think this is an insertion (‘taking’) of OPI[ATE] in BIC.  But ‘heroin, etc’ would suggest OPIATES, surely?  In which case it doesn’t work.  In any case, it’s referring to the film.
"
6517,Plenty of time is lost or reserved,ALOOF,"Definition: reserved
A LO[T] OF
"
6518,Creature such as bird in part,TO A DEGREE,"Definition: in part
A charade of TOAD, EG and REE.  A REE is another name for the REEVE, the female of the RUFF, but my dictionaries mark it as ‘obsolete’, so perhaps not an ideal inclusion in an IoS crossword.  And as the world knows, I like birds; but I’d never heard of that one.
"
6519,Queen’s snotty ‘wit’ disrupted parlour game,TWENTY QUESTIONS,"Definition: parlour game
anagram of QUEENS SNOTTY WIT;
"
6520,First of drivers leaves taxi rank sign for Savoy?,CABBAGE,"Definition: Savoy
I think this is CAB BA[D]GE.
"
6521,Bottom attracts me; breast’s an interesting alternative initially,TITANIA,"Definition: Bottom attracts me
A charade of TIT, AN and IA for the first letters of ‘interesting alternative’.  Referring to *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*, where TITANIA, the Queen of the Fairies, falls in love with Bottom, the weaver, after he’s been made to put on the head of an ass.  And why did Shakespeare transform Bottom into an ‘ass’?  Go figure.
"
6522,Struggle to accept old misfortune,TRAGEDY,"Definition: misfortune
An insertion of AGED in TRY.

Hidden in superioR HONEy.
"
6531,It turns out Charlie’s left you at eastern entrance,INFATUATE,"Definition: entrance
IN FA[C]T, U, AT and E.  ‘It turns out’ for IN FACT?  Hmmm.  Are ‘entrance’ and INFATUATE really synonyms?  If you get the impression that I’m not warming to this puzzle, then you’re right.
"
6532,Quite an upset from long ago,ANTIQUE,"Definition: long ago
anagram of QUITE AN;
"
6533,"A date in March to beware – and time, that is",ID EST,"Definition: that is
A charade of IDES and T giving you the full Latin version of ‘ie’.  ‘Beware the Ides of March’ was the advice given to Caesar, according to Will.  But the Ides of a month had no particular connotation about being dangerous.  Shakespeare made it up.  As indeed he made up lots of things which have enriched our language.
"
6534,A child bearing large staff,PERSONNEL,"Definition: staff
A charade of PERSON, NE and L.  Well, ‘a child’ is PERSON, I suppose.
"
6535,Where you might get buns or tea outside,CHELSEA,"Definition: Where you might get buns
An insertion of ELSE for ‘or’ in CHA for ‘tea’.  CHELSEA BUNS are not rabbits who support The Blues, but sticky cakes.
"
6536,Art bold enough to be noticed in calendar – estimable!,DAREST,"Definition: Art bold enough
Hidden in calenDAR ESTimable.  Daedalus is using ‘art’ in the old-fashioned second person singular sense: ‘Thou art bold enough!’  ‘How darest thou!’  More Shakespearean usage.
"
6537,"As a young man in the East End, don’t play so tough",BEARDLESS,"Definition: As a young man in the East Enddon’t play so tough
My SOED gives for BEARDLESS: ‘ a young, immature man’ but doesn’t mark it as being a Cockney usage.  It gives this for ‘beard’: ‘oppose openly; defy; attack audaciously.’  So if you don’t play so tough, you BEARD LESS.  This is getting silly for an IoS crossword.  It’s a cd cum dd.  I think.
"
6538,Scrap with the French getting wind up?,TRAFALGAR,"I think this a whimsical reversal of RAG LA FART.
"
6539,Germans bombed Euston after Tuesday,TEUTONS,"Definition: Germans
A charade of T and anagram of EUSTON;
"
6540,"In 8 maybe I agree, there’s no end to rowdy, peevish type of politics",YAH,"Definition: peevish type of politics

The award is an OSCAR: so it’s O[S]CAR plus IN and A.  An instrument I only got to know when I restarted doing cryptics.  It comes up quite often, presumably because its letter pattern is helpful to setters.
"
6689,"Dance music, hellish business?",DISCO,"Definition: Dance musichellish business
A cd cum dd, suggesting that DIS CO would be a ‘hellish business’.  DIS is Dante’s infernal city.  Be good in this life and you won’t end up there.

Another cd cum dd.  A BOGEYMAN is said to scare children (witness Raymond Briggs’ *Fungus the Bogeyman*) and the second bit is something to do with golf.

A reversal of EL for the outside letters of ‘evil’ and BANE for ‘poison’, all reversed.  I think a version of BANE was in *Harry Potter*, but I’ll have to check with a child and get back to you.

A charade of TWIN and anagram of SKELETO[N];
"
6694,"One making ace lace, perhaps, seeing flaw in underwear",LADDER,"Definition: flaw in underwear
I could well be wrong, but I think the setter is suggesting that to get from ‘ace’ to ‘lace’ you need to add a letter L.  Which would be L ADDER.  If I am right, I don’t like it much.
"
6695,"Tad broken, hairline fractures fixed",ATTACHED,"Definition: fixed
If you break ‘tad’ then you’ll get ATD; put TACHE for ‘moustache’ or ‘hairline’ in that and you’ve got a word that means ‘fixed’.  The insertion indicator is ‘fractures’.
"
6696,"Having no children, in part by rejection of organ?",SINE PROLE,"Definition: Having no children
If you’re not a fan of Punk’s use of bums, tits and willies humour, then you won’t have approved.  If you are a fan, then you would have liked this clue, because it’s a charade of PENIS reversed next to ROLE.  And PENIS is definitely an ‘organ’, because if you have one, you can play with it, can’t you?  SINE PROLE is a Latin, legal term for ‘without offspring’.

"
6713,Top celestial realignment?,TOTAL ECLIPSE,"Definition: Top celestial realignment
I screwed up this part of the grid by first putting in SOLAR ECLIPSE, which in my defence, is also a correct solution.  This is a bit of a weak cd, unless I am missing something.

An insertion of H in anagram of NO COP; with ‘can be’ as the anagrind and ‘in’ as the insertion indicator.
"
6718,Story of an East London love,ANECDOTE,"Definition: Story
Ah, the double bluff.  ‘East London’ would have most solvers ‘oping for the removal of an aitch.  But no: it’s AN, EC (an East London postcode) and DOTE.  Are DOTE and ‘love’ synonyms?  You love someone, but you dote on them.
"
6719,Cast vote to reject a proposal,VETO,"Definition: to reject a proposal
Nice surface.  anagram of VETO;
"
6720,Even well-fed Conservative has to respect voters,ELECTORATE,"Definition: voters

An insertion of USS in FED.  As in *USS Abraham Lincoln*, on board which George Dubya gave his infamous ‘Mission Accomplished’ speech in 2003.  ‘United States Ship.’  Or if you are a Trekkie, you could have *USS Enterprise*, but nobody’s sure what that stands for.
"
6728,"Back in olden times, Corinthians added fishy oil to greens",BROCCOLI,"Definition: greens
Good grief, this is getting convoluted for a Quiptic.  ‘Olden times’ are BC; put COR for the biblical abbreviation for ‘Corinthians’ reversed in that; then add anagram of OIL; with ‘fishy’ as the anagrind.

See my comment on 1dn.  An insertion of POS for ‘Post Offices’ in OPE[N] which is ‘public’ shortened or ‘contracted’.  But where and by how much do you want me to contract it?

6734,Cook’s sending a boy up to ask about dessert,BAKED ALASKA,"Definition: dessert
See my comment at 1dn.  A charade.  It’s BAKE for ‘cook’, and you have to read the apostrophe S as ‘has’; then a reversal anagram of ‘sending up’ since it’s a down clue of A LAD for ‘a boy’; then (ASK; with ‘about’ as the anagrind.
"
6735,Chaps restrain a rampant rogue being a pain,HEADACHE,"Definition: a pain
An insertion of A CAD in HE and HE.  The reversal indicator for CAD is something to do with flags or heraldry, I think, but I can’t be arsed to look it up.  Or perhaps it’s an anagrind.

An insertion of U and I in JESTS.  Since Everyman hasn’t given us a film this week, I will mention *The Mission* (1986) with Jeremy Irons, who portrayed a Jesuit priest trying to save a South American native tribe.  Good film, although there weren’t many jokes in it.

"
6760,Show direction on pages followed by Conservative,WEST SIDE STORY,"Definition: Show
A charade of WEST, SIDES and TORY.  And I’m sure an entirely unintentional link to the previous clue, because WEST SIDE STORY was inspired by Shakespeare’s *Romeo and Juliet*: two lovers from different sides of the tracks.

Brilliant clue.  An insertion of C[A]MILLA in MAN.  Harold Macmillan, PM from 1957 to 1963.  He has a number of famous quotations attributed to him.  ‘Events, dear boy, events’ is the one I remember best.

A charade of MODE and ST.
"
6764,He appears in this chart at number 2,PERIODIC TABLE,"Definition: He appears in this chart at number 2
My favourite clue this morning.  Wonderfully deceptive surface, and a bit of chemistry: what’s not to like?  *He* is the atomic symbol for Helium, which appears after Hydrogen in second place in the PERIODIC TABLE.  Abundant in the universe as a whole, but rare on earth and required for scientific and medical research, so don’t buy those helium-inflated balloons, okay?

I didn’t much like these two linked clues, since they depend on each other for the definitions.  If you’re no longer CLEAN-SHAVEN, then you’re BEWHISKERED, which is a charade of WHISK[Y] inserted in BEER followed by ED.

"
6810,Wear Scottish flower,DON,"Definition: Scottish flower
As almost always, ‘flower’ is a river, in this case the DON, which flows through Aberdeenshire.  But Commoner could have chosen the river that flows past Bede’s Monastery at Jarrow; or the one on which Doncaster stands.  DON in the ‘wear’ sense is a contraction of DO ON; its antonym is DOFF, from DO OFF.  As in ‘to doff one’s cap’.

"
6827,French joiner houses college servant in African country,EGYPT,"Definition: African country
The French ‘joiner’ is ET, for ‘and’.  In the middle of that is GYP, which is a term that always confuses me.  It’s essentially Oxbridge, but in Cambridge it means the small kitchen at the end of the corridor for use by students; in Oxford, I think it’s what Cambridge students call their ‘bedder’.  Whatever, they are all spoilt too much.
"
6828,Department I can ring up for meals on wheels provider,DINING CAR,"Definition: meals on wheels provider
anagram of D I CAN RING; with ‘up’ as the anagrind.
"
6829,Endlessly deride Peg working in house,SCORPIO,"Definition: house
I’m not rightly sure about this one.  The definition is a ‘house’ of the zodiac.  SCOR is SCOR[N], I think, but the PIO bit I can’t parse.  Peg is Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, but I don’t think that’s what Kairos had in mind.

"
6831,Old physician sheltered by church,LEECH,"Definition: Old physician
I had to go and have a furtle on the internet to fully understand this one. It’s not in fact as I first thought the blood-letting annelid worm; it’s a Middle English, now archaic, word for ‘physician’.  A charade of LEE and CH, but I’m struggling to make LEE mean ‘sheltered’.  ‘Sheltered side’ perhaps, or just ‘shelter’.
"
6832,Something cheesy created by crew in production of Hamlet,EMMENTHAL,"Definition: Something cheesy

"
7325,I will” spoken in part of church,AISLE,"Definition: part of church
I’ll say nothing further, except to say that churchy architectural folk will tell you that in fact brides don’t go down the aisle, because it’s somewhere else; and they most often say ‘I do’ and not ‘I will’.  Ultimately, AISLE is related to the French word ‘une aile’ for ‘a wing’, which strictly is where it is in a church.  So brides don’t go down one, unless they are really having second thoughts.
"
7326,About to kiss and hug,CLIP,"Definition: hug
It’s a charade of C for circa or ‘about’ and LIP, but I can’t see CLIP for ‘hug’.  Anyone?

This just has to be a ‘Bollocks, I’ve painted myself into a corner here and this is all that fits’ clue.  Fine, it’s an anagram, but what this word is doing in an IoS puzzle I don’t know.  Definition: an inversion of the normal order of words, especially for the sake of emphasis, as in the sentence ‘this I must see’.  And I got that straight from Mrs Google, first entry, which is no doubt where the setter got it from.

"
7337,"Turn around having lost son, Paul, perhaps",REVERE,"Definition: Paul, perhaps
Perfectly sound clue, but again there are a lot of options for ‘Paul’; and the three crossing letters all being E didn’t help me.  REVER[S]E for the American Civil War person.

7362,"Place for the other, entwined, lots even?",LOVE NEST,"Definition: Place for the other
I’m sure that you’re all consenting adults, so you’ll know that a LOVE NEST  is a place for a bit of illicit how’s your father, or a bit of ‘the other’, where you might indeed be ‘entwined’ anagram of although that’s the anagrind rather than a reference to the coitus itself).  It’s (LOTS EVEN;

"
7364,State of confusion in German world over lady leader,WELTER,"Definition: State of confusion
A step too far, perhaps, for your Joe Average Monday solver.  You’d have to know that DIE WELT was German for ‘the world’, and then add ER for Brenda or *Elizabeth Regina* (‘lady leader’) to that.  It is a German newspaper, I suppose, and you might have heard of UMWELTFREUNDLICH for ‘environmentally friendly’ or ‘world friendly’.

An insertion of I in PRATE.  PRATE is not a very common word, but it’s cognate with the Dutch PRATEN, which just means ‘to speak’.  Where the ‘too much’ bit meaning comes from, I know not.  I’m guessing that it’s also the root of PRATTLE.

7414,"Soldier, using aromatic substance with hesitation, receiving support",MUSKETEER,"Definition: Soldier
The MUSK and the ER are fairly obvious, but ETE?  I had to search online for this.  Apparently it’s short for ‘education, training, and employment’.  The solution is gettable, but the acronym as the insertion is a bit random, imho.  Or perhaps I’ve got it wrong.

An insertion of C in TRUE.
"
7425,Spins good maiden over — what a surprise!,OH MY GOD,"Definition: what a surprise
!Not a good start, because I can’t parse this.  The anagrind is presumably ‘spins’; the anagram fodder seems to be GOOD M O but can’t be because that’s only six letters; where the H and Y come from I have no clue.
"
7426,Exercise and be cheerful!,CHIN UP,"Definition: Exercisebe cheerful

7442,"Deceitfully uses people easily swayed, initially",DUPES,"Definition: Deceitfully uses people easily swayed
The first letters of the first five words of the clue; the definition is the first five words as well, I suppose.
"
7443,Line some still use in email and voicemail,HYPHEN,"Definition: Line some still use in email and voicemail
Because you can write e-mail or email; but I’m not sure I’d ever write voice-mail, so I might have left that out, since the clue works perfectly well without it.
"

anagram of CAN END SOON; with ‘torture’ as the anagrind.  I know that a NANOSECOND is a very short unit of time, but if someone could tell me where the definition is in this clue, I would be grateful.

"
7450,Coffee often mistakenly ordered as a quick round,ESPRESSO,"Definition: Coffee
I didn’t much like this one, because a beginner is going to struggle with parsing it, if not with solving it.  The setter is referring to the fact that many people, mistakenly, spell it and pronounce it as EXPRESSO, which would be a charade of EXPRESS and O for ’round’.

The central letters of the three places.

An insertion of I in WELD.
"
7453,"Musical crowd, proverbially",TRIO,"Definition: Musical crowd, proverbially
‘Two’s company; three’s a crowd’, as the saying goes.  So a ‘musical crowd’ would be a TRIO.  Well done to anyone who got this without the crossing letters.

7454,Game for watch designed by Apple?,I,"Definition: Game for watch
-SPYApple have apparently just introduced an Apple Watch – what it does apart from tell the time, I don’t know, because I’m not an early adopter.  So since Apple use the ‘I’ prefix for their other products, then I-SPY would be a whimsical solution to the clue.

BIG BROTHE[L] plus R for the last letter of ‘winner’.

7464,Pay to stay in bondage gear not found in Fifty Shades of Grey?,GOLDEN HANDCUFFS,"Definition: Pay to stay in bondage

Hmmm.  A bit naughty in a Quiptic perhaps, when you’ve only got ?E?L to work with.  It’s a dd.  The first definition you’d probably only ever hear in the expression ‘in one fell swoop’.  Guess who coined that usage?  That bloke whose 400th anniversary we celebrated this weekend, natch (*Macbeth*, since you ask).  The second is found in the word used in Cumbria particularly, but also elsewhere in the North, for a ‘hill’: there are lots of them, but SCAFELL is perhaps best known.  It comes from the Old Norse word *fiall*, for ‘mountain’; and like BECK and TARN, also ultimately Norse words, it’s only found in the North because the Viking invasion/settlement never really got south of the Danelaw, in linguistic terms at least.  Swarm of bloody economic migrants, the Vikings.  Who’d want that kind of stuff these days on this Sceptred Isle?

9197,Provide European with gag,EQUIP,"Definition: Provide
A charade of E and QUIP.
"
9198,Film abuse in Hollywood,HAZE,"Definition: Filmabuse in Hollywood
I didn’t like this at all.  Firstly, ?A?E is not much help.  Secondly, ‘film’ for HAZE is not a great synonym.  Thirdly, the definition is pretty obscure: yes, the surface is telling us that it’s American English, and Collins gives ‘to subject (fellow students) to ridicule or abuse’, but since I don’t live in America this was new to me.  It’s a dd.
"
9199,Temptress to rage and club furry mammal,VAMPIRE BAT,"Definition: furry mammal
A charade of VAMP, IRE and BAT.  Have seen this recently somewhere else, but I can’t remember where.  Some pedants (not me, obviously) would say that ‘furry’ is redundant, since all mammals are furry/hairy (yes, even whales and dolphins).  Cue biological debate.

anagram of A GOLFER P; for the children’s game.
"
9201,Retro Fairy King embraces without thinking,REFLEX,"Definition: without thinking
Took me ages to see this, and it’s not my favourite clue.  It’s ELF reversed (‘retro fairy’) in REX.  But in our house, an ELF is not a ‘fairy’.  An ELF is a small, ugly-looking male creature with big ears; a fairy is a small, delicate, female creature.  It’s not the TOOTH ELF who puts a pound coin under children’s pillows, is it?

9213,Broadcast live with a mike,BEAM,"Definition: Broadcast
A charade of BE for ‘live’, A and M for ‘mike’ in the phonetic alphabet.  Most writers, I think, would write MIC for a ‘microphone’, but Vigo’s version is in dictionaries as an alternative.

I wasn’t keen on this and it was my LOI.  It’s a charade of IMP and EL for ‘elevated railway’, an abbreviation in American English.  The best-known one is in Chicago, I think.  Does IMPEL mean ‘goad’?  For me, it’s more like ‘force’; whereas ‘goad’ is ‘tease’.

"
9846,Room where the food of love is produced in classical style,CHAMBER MUSIC,"Definition: classical style
I might have fancied a question mark at the end here, since it’s a bit whimsical, and the surface leads more to MUSIC CHAMBER anyway. CHAMBER for ‘room’; and for MUSIC you need *Twelfth Night*:

I can’t really make this work either.  I think the setter is asking us to put R for the phonetic alphabet ‘Romeo’ in anagram of SEEN; and precede that with LIST for ‘inclination’.  But then you’d need ‘about’ to be the anagrind and the insertion indicator, and I don’t see that.

More ASSES, but I can’t make this work either.  It’s a charade of ASS and AIL, but if the ‘that’s’ is to be read as ‘that has’, then ‘unwell’ can’t translate as AIL, can it?

"
9880,Finch from America departing for a Greek peninsula,ATTICA,"Definition: Greek peninsula
The ‘Finch’ is ATTICUS Finch, the lawyer and protagonist in *To Kill a Mockingbird*, by Harper Lee.  Although the ‘America’ might have prompted you in the right direction, we need that for the wordplay: remove US and add A.  And no, you can’t have a bird link, because the bird’s not the answer.  However, I haven’t been able to do one for ages, so setters take note, please.

A dd, with the latter definition being a bit whimsical.
"
11112,Passes water hearing struggle for breath,WHEEZE,"Definition: struggle for breath
If setters continue to put the homophone indicator (in this case, ‘hearing’) in the middle of the clue, they will continue to attract some mild criticism from solvers who don’t like that sort of thing, because two possible answers present themselves.  I personally am chilled about it.  A homophone of WEES for ‘passes water’.

A charade of RIG and anagram of INTO A;  This wasn’t my favourite from Viga this morning.  RIGATONI is of course a tubular pasta, but to describe it as a ‘dish’ is perhaps a bit of a stretch.  Add a tomato-based sauce and tomato’s best friend basil, sprinkle with parmesan and then you’re talking.

"
11201,Rear one inside?  It might make father more distant,RECITAL,"Definition: It might make father more distant
An insertion of I in RECTAL gives you the answer.  I think the setter is suggesting that if you put R in FATHER you get FARTHER, which is ‘more distant’, but how we get there, I’m afraid I can’t explain.

11202,Daddy there is high and dry,DEHYDRATED,"Definition: dry
anagram of DADDY THERE; with ‘high’ as the anagrind.

PA[T]ER reversed.
"
11204,Papa gets longer in jug,PITCHER,"Definition: jug
A charade of P for ‘Papa’ in the phonetic alphabet and ITCHER.  This in my opinion is stretching the language a bit too far.  If you long to do something, then at a stretch you could be described as a ‘longer’; ‘long’ and ITCH are synonyms, whence ITCHER, and it will be buried in a dictionary somewhere, no doubt.

anagram of SIRE SAT NOT;
"
11208,Father takes Portuguese gents snack,PAPPADOMS,"Definition: snack
I think this is a charade of PAPPA and DOMS.  A DOM is a Portuguese equivalent of DON, thus ‘gent’.  I think this clue is unnecessarily complicated: PAPPADOMS can be spelled several different ways, because it’s transliterated; DOM for ‘Portuguese gent’ is rather obscure (it’s an alternative to DON); ‘gents’ in the surface reading needs an apostrophe for the surface to make sense; and I wouldn’t describe a PAPPADOM/PAPADUM/POPPADOM/POPPODAM/POPADOM etc as a ‘snack’ either: a snack is something you eat on its own, and I can’t imagine doing that with a PAPPADOM.
"
11209,Firm dads keep quiet in police premises,COP SHOPS,"Definition: police premises
A charade of CO and an insertion of SH in POPS.

A charade of OR and DEAL.
"
11227,Stick with excellent source of claret to get a good drink,JAMAICA RUM,"Definition: drink
I can’t quite work this out. It’s a charade, which I see as JAM for ‘stick’, AI for A1 or ‘excellent’, and C for the first letter of ‘claret’, then A; but then that leaves us with RUM for ‘good’, which I don’t fathom. Or you could have A inserted in CRU at the end, but then that leaves you with M. Some kind person will help me out here, I’m sure.
"
11228,Plant crowns of imported rhubarb in shrubbery,IRIS,"Definition: Plant
The first letters of the last four words of the clue.

A charade of A and anagram of ISSUE;
"
11235,one returning to cold island in frozen water,ICEBERG,"Definition: frozen water
Normally the advice is to ignore ellipses, since they’re just there to connect two vaguely related surfaces. Here, however, you do have to go back to the previous clue, since ‘one’ refers to a ‘bird’, in this case the GREBE. If you reverse that and IC for ‘cold’ and ‘island’, you’ve got your answer.

11238,wanting husband for countrywoman,PEASANT,"Definition: countrywoman
This is referring to 23ac, the answer to which is GAME BIRD, of which a PHEASANT is an example (and for that reason I might have fancied ‘for example’ in the clue after ’23)’. You need to take ‘wanting’ as ‘lacking’, so it’s P[H]EASANT.

A charade of ORC for Tolkien’s character and HID. Is it okay to describe an ORC as a ‘goblin’? I was never into *Lord of the Rings*, or indeed Tolkien in general, so someone else will have to say.

"
11378,Hear about a noble comeback,REAPPEAR,"Definition: comeback

An insertion of END in TRY.
"
11407,Chance 22 had to cut stress,ACCIDENT,"Definition: Chance
Took me a while to sort this one out. 22 is TEES, our esteemed setter; so ’22 had’ is TEES HAD or ‘I’D. Stick that in ACCENT for ‘stress’ and there you go.
"
11408,Foreign Office having back to wall,BUREAU,"Definition: Foreign Office
This must be BUREAU, but I haven’t a scooby how it works.
"
11409,Struggling to reveal what makes flight unnecessary,ELEVATOR,"Definition: what makes flight unnecessary

A charade of R for the first letter of ‘revolt’ and APT. When I see even careful writers coming out with ‘she was wrapped in thought’ it makes me grumpy.
"
11413, Reports government workers excavating this,STATEMENTS,"Definition:  Reports
Another one that took a bit of teasing out: Tees is asking you to make a charade of STATE MEN and T[HI]S, on the grounds that if you ‘excavate’ the last word of the clue, you’ll be left with the outside letters.
"
11414,Deliberate with student group hostile towards Tories?,CLASS,"Definition: hostile towards Tories?
-CONSCIOUSA charade of CLASS for ‘group’ and CONSCIOUS for ‘deliberate’; I think it’s just a suggestion that if you don’t like the Tories it’s because they’re for the most part Eton/Oxford-educated knobheads, but I could be missing something.
"
11415,Pure tar substance dissolved,ABSOLUTE,"Definition: Pure
A charade of AB for sailor or ‘tar’ and SOLUTE for the substance dissolved in the SOLVENT, which gives you the SOLUTION (although not this one).

"
11420,Sneer at forged art making money?,EARNEST,"Definition: art making money?
I always forget this trick. It’s anagram of SNEER AT; with ‘forged’ as the anagrind. The ‘art making money’ bit comes from Early Modern English where there was still a distinction between second person singular (thou/thee) and second person plural (ye/you). The singular of the verb *to be* was ‘thou art’ (irregular) but this form was normally inflected with the ‘-est’ ending: thou givest, thou takest, thou bringest. So ‘thou art making money’ could whimsically be ‘thou EARNEST’. Many modern European languages have kept this singular/plural distinction, but standard English very sensibly has defaulted to ‘you’ for both.
"
11421,English crowd spoke up for expansion,DIASTOLE,"Definition: expansion
A reversal (‘up’ since it’s a down clue) of E, LOT and SAID. A synonym for ‘expansion’ mainly heard when measuring blood pressure or talking about the cardiac cycle.
"

How is your passive vocabulary this morning? Mine just about coped with this, mainly because of a Catholic upbringing which introduced me to the concepts of calumny and detraction (look it up, but it’s not that interesting/useful). An insertion of ALUMNI in C for the other black suit, AT and ES for the even letters of ‘Kelso’. Tees correct in his classics as always: it’s ALUMNI because it’s ‘old boys’; ‘old girls’ would be ALUMNAE.
"
11423,Still penning verse to cause upset,INVERT,"Definition: upset
An insertion of V in INERT.
"
11424,Ravel went bonkers in Tzigane at the end,ENTWINE,"Definition: Ravel
A charade of anagram of WENT;, IN and E for the last letter of Maurice Ravel’s rhapsody *Tzigane*. I learnt something from this clue: the name comes from ‘gypsy’, and is cognate with a female gypsy in French, *une gitane* (it’s also a make of bike, but don’t get confused).
"
11425,One’s temperature raised with inflammation and fatigue,TIREDNESS,"Definition: fatigue
A charade of I and T reversed and REDNESS.
"
11426,Dark strong beer for Max Aldorfer?,NIGHT PORTER,"Definition: Max Aldorfer?

A charade of SID[E] reversed and MAY. The reversal indicator is ‘goes west’ and the removal indicator is ‘falling short’. The clue is faulty, however, because in no way could Teresa MAY be described as ‘Tory leader’. Or perhaps that was implicit in Poins’ clue.

A charade of EVEN for ‘flat’, SO and NG for the first and last letters (‘outskirts’) of NuremberG. I can’t quite see how SO equates to ‘that will do’, however.  Or maybe Poins wants us to take EVEN SO for ‘that will do’.  Is that right?

A charade of COM and MA for Master of Arts or ‘academic’ gives you the punctuation mark that can be used to divide a sentence, or list. I do proofreading professionally, and in my experience, the comma is one of the most misused punctuation marks. It looks like a tadpole, but is also a butterfly.
"
11519,Competes fiercely after commencement of game,CRAPS,"I think the setter is saying that if you add S to this card game at the start, you get SCRAPS, which is ‘competes fiercely’, but I can’t quite get my head round how exactly that works.

anagram of PAPAYA LADEN;  ‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away’ is the proverb. To big up our Welsh correspondents, it apparently originated in Pembrokeshire in the 1800s: ‘Eat an apple on going to bed, And you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread’.

"

11716,Be an alien consuming elevenses?,EXIST,"Definition: Be

11870,"He’s up frequently in night, on the telephone",HORSEMAN,"Definition: He’s up frequentlynight, on the telephone
I think I see how this works; I’m just struggling to find a label for it. A dd cum cd/homophone, perhaps. If someone is ‘up frequently’ they are on horseback or riding; and ‘night’ is a homophone (‘on the telephone’) of ‘knight’, who is a HORSEMAN.
"
11871,Why an operation at first is botched carelessly,ANYHOW,"Definition: carelessly
anagram of WHY AN O;
"
11872,Quality attracting retired sailor to become a pirate,WATER RAT,"Definition: a pirate
A charade of WATER and TAR reversed. WATER for ‘quality’? I had to get the crane and the magnifying glass out to trawl through my SOED, which finally yielded the following under definition III/10b:
"

11875,Sign of spring in Cambridge minister,GEMINI,"Definition: Sign of spring
Hidden in CambridGE MINIster. Gemini goes from 20 May to 20 June, so could just be described as a ‘spring’ sign of the zodiac.
"
11876,"Like this good clue, it might have you stuck!",SPOONERISM,"I didn’t care for this much, partly because it was my LOI and I couldn’t see it, and partly because I’m not a fan of spoonerism clues, since not everyone agrees how they work and that often leads to ultimately fruitless arguments. Silvanus is suggesting that if you made a SPOONERISM of ‘good clue’ you’d end up with COULD GLUE, which ‘might have you stuck’. At least the spoonerism works here.
"
11877,"Cook, silly man, with no filling for cake mix",MISCELLANY,"Definition: mix
anagram of SILLY MAN C[AK]E; The anagrind is ‘cook’.
"
11878,Contrive to stop working,CUT OUT,"Definition: Contrivestop working
A dd. My SOED gives a couple of definitions of ‘contrive’ that could vaguely be synonymous with CUT OUT, but happen I’m missing something here.
"
11879,Crazy for one in photograph to become successful through personal effort,SELF,"Definition: successful through personal effort
-MADETalking of the SOED, its big sister, the OED, introduced SELFIE as one of its new words of the year a while back. Here you need to take the I out of that and replace it with MAD.

anagram of ARREST KE[Y];
"
11883,Cricket’s unique appeal,HOWZAT,"Definition: appeal
?Sounds like I’m being a bit arsey about this offering from Silvanus, and I don’t mean to be; but this one struck me as a bit weak. So now everyone else is going to tell me that they loved it. It’s a cd. For overseas solvers and those who find cricket as interesting as I find golf, I will explain that in order for a batsman to be dismissed in cricket, under Law 31 an ‘appeal’ has to be made to the umpire, who – if he is of the opinion that the batsman is out – will raise his finger.  The appeal is strictly HOW’S THAT?, but sounds like HOWZAT? It’s the accepted spelling, so the setter is on firm ground from that point of view. The actual appeal in current cricket often sounds more like HOWAAAAZEEEEEE, screamed in a simian-like way, accompanied by outstretched, pleading arms and followed by the double teapot when the appeal is turned down.
"
11884,"Under a therapist continuously? Yes, indeed",RATHER,"Definition: Yes, indeed

"
11889,Bills for sisters attending the courts,WILLIAMS,"Definition: Billssisters attending the courts
I thought this one was clever, and it put a smile on my face. It’s another dd cum cd. Bills are really WILLIAMS, and the second bit is referring to Serena and Venus WILLIAMS, the tennis sisters.
"
11890,Resist law regarding shop trading?,COUNTERACT,"Definition: Resistlaw regarding shop trading?
Another clue in the cd/dd vein. A ‘law regarding shop trading’ could whimsically be referred to as a COUNTER ACT.

"
11892,Mysterious drug boy accepts drunk,ESOTERIC,"Definition: Mysterious
A charade of E for Ecstasy or ‘drug’ and ERIC for ‘boy’ with SOT for ‘drunk’ inserted. Why ERIC is a ‘boy’ and not a man, I can’t say. Sometimes setters use ‘boy’ when it’s a shortened name, like WILL for WILLIAM. But ERIC is just ERIC. Cryptics are a mystery to me sometimes.

A charade of DAM and ASK. The cloth from which the colour comes originated in DAMASCUS.
"
11896,Reportedly encounter gloomy character shooting star,METEOR,"Definition: shooting star
For those who don’t get the surface reading, ‘shooting star’ is nothing meteorological. ‘Star’ is slang for cocaine, so someone ‘shooting star’ would be injecting cocaine. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, and paid attention to too many Hoskins puzzles. Whatever, it’s a homophone to finish off. The homophone indicator is ‘reportedly’ and it’s MEET for ‘encounter’ and EYEORE for ‘gloomy character’. EYEORE is Winnie-the-Pooh’s mate and a personal hero of mine because he’s even more grumpy and anti-social than me.
"
11897,"I might have known,” said Eeyore. “After all, one can’t complain. I have my friends. Somebody spoke to me only yesterday. ", A,nd was it last week or the week before that Rabbit bumped into me and said ‘Bother!’ The Social Round. Always something going on.”

A[HO]RIZON[T]A[L]  ‘Arrangement’ looks like an anagrind, but we don’t really need one, do we? The letters appear in the correct order anyway.

-NOTA charade of HAVE and TON reversed. I’d always thought TON was just ‘fashion’, but it can also mean ‘fashionable people’, I discovered.

A charade of LIKE and A in MD for ‘doctor’.
"
11974,Fellow needing no introduction gets wine in bulk,EXTENT,"Definition: bulk

13121,"Unhappy Lib Dem politician, in 2015 losing seat and pessimistic ultimately",MISERABLE,"Definition: Unhappy
This took a bit of sorting out (and research to check my logic). Now that Nick Clegg is no longer an MP, ‘Lib Dem politician’ is almost always Vince Cable, and so it is here. Until the very end of 2015, when he was knighted and became Sir Vince Cable, he was simply MISTER CABLE: take T and C for the last letters of ‘seat’ and ‘pessimistic’ away from that, and you’re left with MISERABLE. Vince always looks a bit miserable, with a natural hangdog expression, but I have always thought him a well-informed, committed and effective politician.

anagram of STREAMING;
"
13129,"Cake‘s been eaten, some of us have heard",SCONE,"Definition: Cake
Is a SCONE a cake? Is it pronounced to rhyme with ‘gone’ or ‘bone’? To make Silvanus’ clue work, you’d have to favour the former, since the setter is suggesting that in answer to the question ‘Where is the cake?’, the reply might be, if it had been eaten, ‘S’gone.’ Having said this out loud to myself (in private) several times, I think it’s a pretty good homophone (‘some of us have heard’.) Other opinions on homophones are available.

A ‘Christmas poem’ might be a DEC[EMBER] ODE.

13145,Wealth of Roman coins bearing head of Tiberius,ASSETS,"Definition: Wealth
The ‘Roman coin’ is an AS. Two of them would be ASSES. Insert T for the first letter of ‘Tiberius’ in that and you’ve got your answer. I would usually expect ‘bearing’ in a down clue to indicate the placement of the T as the first letter; but I suppose (to carry on the Roman theme) when Mary was ‘bearing’ Jesus she carried him inside her, so it works that way for me as well.

13758,"Gather in support for impressive parade leader (5,7)",GRAND MARSHAL,"Definition: parade leader
I can only suggest that this is a charade of GRAND for ‘impressive’ and MARSHAL for ‘gather in support’. How the subsidiary indication tells us to get there, I know not.

anagram of AHEA[D] BARN; with ~~‘dance’~~ ‘forged’ as the anagrind. Dance is definitely not my specialist subject, so since all the crossers were vowels, it was a question of seeing how to arrange the consonants to see what looked most likely. BAHARENA sounded quite tempting for a while.
"
14382, Slight charge for refreshments – not bad,BARB,"Definition:  Slight
Not the most obvious wordplay: it’s BARB[ILL]. Good surface though.

14384,"Superman’s motive, it’s said, is philanthropy",LARGESSE,"Definition: philanthropy

"
14441,Corrupts sweetheart in rolling fields,DEFILES,"Definition: Corrupts
An insertion of E in anagram of FIELDS; The insertion indicator is ‘in’ and the anagrind is ‘rolling’. Where does the E come from? From the middle of ‘swEet’, in other words, ‘sweet heart’. An increasingly small number of people object to this device, but if you are new to all this, you can safely ignore them and let them get equally apoplectic about ‘midnight’ and ‘Gateshead’ clueing the letter G, and about 18dn in this puzzle.
"
14442,"Rattle copper, as an example",CONDUCTOR,"Definition: Rattlecopper, as an example
A dd. The first part requires a bit of GK, but you can’t say that Sir Simon Rattle isn’t world-renowned.

An insertion of RAY in PER.
"
14448,Recites aloud instrumental parts?,REEDS,"Definition: instrumental parts
A homophone of READS. The homophone indicator is ‘aloud’. For those who’ve come here to learn, I’ll explain why I think that 26ac is fine, but that this clue is less fine. In 26ac, the homophone indicator, because of its position in the clue, can only be referring to ‘pen’, so it has to be a homophone of its synonym, ‘write’. Here, the homophone indicator ‘aloud’ is in the middle, so it could be read as referring to either the first or the last parts of the clue. It fits more comfortably with the first from the surface reading, for sure; but following the cryptic grammar it could equally be indicating a homophone of REEDS. So you don’t know until you’ve got some crossing letters which the answer is (and fair dinkum to Matilda, the ambiguity is indeed resolved by the crosser). There endeth the lesson. Other views on the use of this device are available.

14462,Transport for Bryan?,FERRY,"Definition: TransportBryan
More GK, but with the definition clearly as ‘transport’ and F?R?Y, we musn’t grumble. The unusual spelling of ‘Bryan’ should have helped too: it’s referring to Bryan FERRY of Roxy Music fame. A dd.
"
14463,"Entertained by commercial featuring Clio, perhaps",AMUSED,"Definition: Entertained
An insertion of MUSE in AD. Clio is one of the nine MUSES in Greek mythology (of history in her case), and is nearly but not quite as popular with setters as her mate Erato.  The surface is of course referring to the Renault car.

A charade of M, ID and WIFE. Interesting etymology: *mid* was common in Old and Middle English as a preposition but has been completely superseded in Modern English by ‘with’ (except in this word). It’s cognate with Modern German *mit* and Modern Dutch *met*. *Wyf* was the Middle English word for ‘woman’; its use to mean a married woman (or ‘mate’ as Vigo has it here) came later.  So the word comes from *mid* and *wyf*, for the ‘woman who is with’ the mother at childbirth.

14522,Don’t get so excited‘? I’m astonished and illuminated!,COOL IT,"Definition: Don’t get so excited
A charade of COO! and LIT.
"
14523,Break-fast time?,EASTER,"Definition: Break-fast time?
Not long before we get a contentious clue. It’s a cd, because Easter in the Christian tradition is the end of the forty days of Lent, so is the time when the fast associated with Lent would be broken (and of course ‘breakfast’ itself as the first meal of the day has this connotation). I don’t understand why the setter has used a hyphen: ‘break-fast’ is meaningless. Just ‘breakfast’ would have worked because you could then have relied on the ‘lift and separate’ principle. Whether that would have been a good device to use in an Everyman crossword is debatable.
"
14524,DCI endlessly wedded to poetical writing: Morse is a good example,CODE,"Definition: Morse is a good example
You need to remove the outside letters of ‘DCI’ and then add ODE.
"
14525,Insufficient funds to obtain biscuits,SHORTBREAD,"Definition: biscuits
A charade of SHORT and BREAD for a slang word for ‘money’.
"
14526,"Disrespectfully, the Queen’s on the side of a road leading to a windswept village",LIZARD,"Definition: a windswept village
Fairly random surface, but we’ll move on past that. A charade of LIZ (aka Brenda or Her Maj), A and RD. LIZARD is a village on The Lizard, a peninsula in Cornwall which is near the most south-westerly point of England.  It is no doubt often windy, but it’s not exactly world-renowned for it.
"
14527," Miracle cure: get practically starkers, caked in dirt",SNAKE OIL,"Definition:  Miracle cure
An insertion of NAKE[D] in SOIL.
"
14528, Spicy snacks go with Italian lager,PEPPERONI,"Definition:  Spicy snacks
A charade of PEP and PERONI, which is indeed an ‘Italian lager’. PEPPERONI is spicy; but I personally wouldn’t consider it a ‘snack’, even less ‘snacks’. If the setter’s defence is that it’s a borrowing from an Italian word which is a plural, I’m afraid that doesn’t wash (with me, anyway). He or she has of course had to use the plural in English to make ‘go’ work as part of the clue.
"
14529,Goitre has no appeal: it’s a queasy sight,GORE,"Definition: queasy sight
GO[IT]RE. The crosswordland correspondence of IT for ‘sex appeal’.
"
14530,"Scammers, pests and menaces, primarily",SPAM,"Definition: Scammers, pests and menaces, primarily
The initial letters of the first four words of the clue. An attempt at a cad, except that ‘scammers, pests and menaces’ are the mindless idiots who send SPAM; they aren’t SPAM itself.
"
14531, I’d like to sleep easy after a massage,YES PLEASE,"Definition:  I’d like to
Excellent clue. anagram of SLEEP EASY;
"
14532,French can add butter to both sides of,BASTILLE,"Definition: French can
As well as the entertainment of a cryptic crossword, we have the added bonus of playing ‘guess the missing word’. My theory is that it is a word that clues for ILL, since that’s what you have to insert in BASTE for ‘add butter’ to give you the word for the French prison (‘can’) famous from the Revolution. I am happy to be corrected if the clue is in fact complete.
"
14533,Vigorously resist habits’ – one who has them,SISTER,"Definition: habits’ – one who has them
anagram of RESIST; with ‘vigorously’ as the anagrind.
"
14534,"With time to spare, foolishly romanticise a far-off place",MICRONESIA,"Definition: a far-off place
anagram of ROMAN[T]ICISE; The removal indicator is ‘to spare’; the anagrind is ‘foolishly’. Clueing MICRONESIA as ‘a far-off place’ could be construed as loose, I fancy.
"
14535,"White lie, mostly tall story ultimately",LILY,"Definition: White
A charade of LI[E] and LY for the last letters of ‘tall’ and ‘story’. None of my dictionaries give ‘white’ as a definition of LILY. Lily-white is an adjective, often used to describe skin; but it doesn’t follow that LILY means ‘white’.
"
14536,The aged are welcomed into German band,GARTER,"Definition: band
An insertion of ART in GER. ‘Art’ as in ‘thou art’, the archaic second person singular of the verb* to be* which has been replaced in Modern English with ‘you are’.

"
14540,One of us overheard where vitamin C can be found,INSIDER,"Definition: One of us
A homophone of IN CIDER. You can’t argue with the homophone, but you might find ‘cider’ a less than obvious option as a source of Vitamin C. It does contain traces of it.
"
14541,19 martial arts are on the rise? Not entirely,ASTRAL,"Definition: 19
The previous two long-standing Everymen eschewed cross-referencing clues, since it’s a crossword for less experienced and new solvers. I personally think that practice should continue. The solution to 19 is STELLAR, and it’s hidden reversed in martiaL ARTS Are. ‘On the rise’ works since it’s a down clue.
"
14542,"Company, they say, with problem, so it’s said: Freeman Hardy Willis, say",THREESOME,"Definition: Freeman Hardy Willis, say
There’s a lot of saying going on here. A charade of THREE and SOME. The latter part of the solution is a homophone (‘so it’s said’) of SUM or ‘problem’. The former part (I think) comes from the saying ‘two’s company; three’s a crowd’. Except that THREE is ‘crowd’ and not ‘company’. I am losing the will to live here.

An insertion of HAM in SING.
"
14547,Sauce added principally into Italian food?,PASSATA,"Definition: Sauce added principally into Italian food?

A charade of S and P for the first letters of ‘straining’ and ‘posterior’ and LAT for the common abbreviation for the *latissimus dorsi* muscles. Is SPLAT an amusing noise? To about the same extent that this puzzle was amusing, I would aver.  Which wasn’t very.

F[L]AME
"
14562,Data may be on-board here for business,ENTERPRISE,"Definition: Data may be on-board herebusiness
I’m hoping there’s a better parsing than mine. I can only think it’s a dd: there would be data on board the Starship Enterprise with James T Kirk at the helm, and then ENTERPRISE is also of course a ‘business’.

14563,Wedding venue starts to prepare elegant finger food,CANAP,"Definition: finger food
ÉAlways good to have a bit of Biblical knowledge when Kairos is in town. A charade of CANA and PE for the first letters of ‘prepare’ and ‘elegant’.

14569,Write hurriedly to cancel test money,SCRATCH,"Definition: Write hurriedlycanceltestmoney
I have not seen one of these for a while: not a dd, nor a td, but a qd – a quadruple definition. I think these four example sentences nail it down:

A charade of P for the last letter of ‘pop’ and ELVIS. I am not convinced that ‘hips’ and PELVIS are entirely the same thing, even in crosswordland.
"
14813,Country club hotel is not allowing starters,CHINA,"Definition: Country
The first letters of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth words of the clue.

"
14815,"Unpleasantly cold, a roly-poly pudding",ALOOF,"Definition: Unpleasantly cold
A charade of A and FOOL reversed (‘roly-poly’). Might have confused overseas solvers: FOOL for a cold dessert made of pureed fruit is a distinctly British invention, I fancy.
"
14816,Musical number requiring tenor with nifty footwear,TEA FOR TWO,"Definition: Musical number
A charade of T for ‘tenor’ and anagram of FOOTWEAR;
"
14817,"Kohl has row in Europe, the old rivals taking sides",EYELINERS,"Definition: Kohl
Goodness, this was a parsing and a half (and a questionable definition). The surface reading is reminding you of Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor from 1982 to 1998, but the definition is the following:
"
14818,"Samson gutted, full of anger: ‘Delilah!’",SIREN,"Definition: Delilah
The setter is asking you to remove the inner letters (‘gutted’) of ‘Samson’ and then fill the gap with IRE. SIREN in this sense refers to the sea nymphs of Greek mythology, part woman and part bird, who lured mariners to destruction by their seductive singing. It is used in a contemporary sense to refer to a woman who is attractive but dangerous. Delilah of Biblical fame would fit that description, I think. Nice surface reading in this clue.
"
14819,"Nosing around, taking in north Berkshire village",SONNING,"Definition: Berkshire village
An insertion of N in anagram of NOSING; gives you the Berkshire village that is famous for nothing, as far as I can see. Apart from being the home of Teresa May, when she’s not in Downing Street or begging on the streets in Brussels.

A dd.
"
14821,"One’s in independent company, producing French playwright",IONESCO,"Definition: French playwright
I knew him, but a bit obscure for an Everyman, perhaps. Gettable from the clear cluing and a few crossers, though: it’s ONES in I and CO.

A charade of ST and anagram of THREW;
"
14823,Impersonating wild dingo,DOING,"Definition: Impersonating
anagram of DINGO;
"
14824,"Full of wickedness, Lawson’s cooking for family",SONS,"Definition: family
-IN-LAWAn insertion of SIN in anagram of LAWSON; Another good surface reading, referencing the TV chef Nigella Lawson. The ‘wickedness’ is perhaps apposite: her choice of attire when presenting is often *décolleté* and she has been christened ‘the Queen of Gastroporn’. She may well be, but her recipe for Parmesan French Toast is awesome.
"
14825,"No matter which of you hoovers, we will be messy",WHOSOEVER,"Definition: No matter which of you
Plenty of anagrams in this Everyman, which is as it should be. anagram of HOOVERS WE;
"
14826,"Feminist with endless desire, foremost of radicals",GREER,"Definition: Feminist
‘Feminist’, five letters starting with G is a bit of a gimme. GREE[D] plus R for the first letter of ‘radicals’. Could be considered a cad (the clue, not her), because Professor Germaine GREER has just turned 80, is still active, and could certainly be described as ‘radical’.
"
14827,"In part of Australia, to interbreed is epitome of bravery",VICTORIA CROSS,"Definition: epitome of bravery
A charade of the Australian state VICTORIA and CROSS in its hybrid sense.
"
14828,Shorten to make tight and fashionable,CLOSE IN,"Definition: Shorten

"
14834,Ant scrambled up mountain without man’s involvement,NATURAL,"Definition: without man’s involvement
A charade of anagram of ANT; and URAL. If you read ‘up’ as ‘on top of’, then the clue works, but I’m not madly in love with URAL for ‘mountain’ in the singular.
"
14835,"With trendy element, weakens story",WATERSHIP DOWN,"Definition: story
An insertion of HIP for ‘trendy’ in WATERS DOWN gives you Richard Adams’ rabbit adventure story. I’m not madly in love either with the use of ‘with element’ as an insertion indicator; it’s novel, that’s for sure.
"
14836,Not working until The Telegraph’s approaching deadline,DOWN TO THE WIRE,"Definition: approaching deadline
A charade of DOWN, TO THE and WIRE.
"
14837,Ignore Brexiteer admitting defeat before start of referendum,GLOSS OVER,"Definition: Ignore
An insertion of LOSS in [Michael] GOVE followed by R for the first letter of ‘referendum’. You didn’t know Gove was a Brexiteer? Have you not been listening carefully these last three years?

anagram of BRING HER A;
"
14839," City‘s ‘New Look, Old Vibe’ essentially retrograde",NAIROBI,"Definition:  City

"
14840,"With tweaks, could be an award-winning actress",WALTERS,"Definition: an award-winning actress
A charade of W and ALTERS gives you Julie WALTERS, who is a multi award-winning actress. My faves are her roles as the ballet teacher in *Billy Elliot* and as Rita in *Educating Rita*, but she’s done shedloads of other good stuff.
"

A dd.
"
14842,Coronary artery bypasses? No!,NARY A,"Definition: No
Hidden in coroNARY Artery. A rather old-fashioned phrase, meaning ‘not a’ or ‘no’. Nary a week goes by when I don’t miss the old Everyman. But this one was, let’s be fair, pretty good. Thank you to the setter.

"
14859,Line in sacred text upset prostitute,HARLOT,"Definition: prostitute
An insertion of L in TORAH reversed (‘upset’, since it’s a down clue). The TORAH is a sacred text in the Jewish tradition: what it exactly refers to is interpreted variously.
"
14860,Company providing lifts back to outskirts of Inverness,OTIS,"Definition: Company providing lifts
A rather strange trade name for a definition (although it’s a good surface reading). A reversal of TO followed by IS for the outside letters of ‘Inverness’.
"
14861, Initial pairing of New Moon and Aries around the 3rd of August,MONOGRAM,"Definition:  Initial
Another nicely constructed surface. An insertion of G for the third letter of ‘August’ in anagram of MOON; and RAM, the sign representing ‘Aries’.

All things are possible with a steady hand and a sharp razor. Hidden in shAVEN GEnital.
"
14863,Record Irishman coming up on Ecstasy,TAPE,"Definition: Record
A reversal (‘coming up’, again because it’s a down clue) of PAT followed by E. I remember a discussion a while ago now on the Indy thread where some folk considered ‘Pat’ for ‘Irishman’ pejorative.
"
14864,Drained delta on estate,DRANK,"Definition: Drained
A charade of D for the ‘delta’ in the phonetic alphabet and RANK. This definition of ‘estate’, as ‘order’ or ‘class’ is given in my dictionaries, but marked as ‘dated’.

An insertion of A in anagram of BRUCE ANDY;
"
14866,"Cab, say, dropping Oscar in middle of ring road",CALLOWAY,"Definition: Cab, say
This is a bit unfair, I think, because without the General Knowledge it’s not easily guessable, and the GK is obscure (for me, anyway). It’s referring to the American Jazz musician and bandleader Cab CALLOWAY, and is an insertion of O (more phonetic alphabet) in CALL and WAY.
"
14867,Group seen performing with Mel B on tour,ENSEMBLE,"Definition: Group
Two anagrams: anagram of SEEN; and anagram of MEL B; Two anagrinds as well: ‘performing’ and ‘on tour’. Mel B is a Spice Girl, sometimes referred to as ‘the one who could sing’.

14869,Forest defender denying second to Scottish team,RANGER,"Definition: Forest defender
Another great surface reading. RANGER[S]
"
14870,Youth accepts universal homage,LAUD,"Definition: homage
An insertion of U in LAD. LAUD is given as a noun in dictionaries, so fair enough to have ‘homage’ as a synonym.
"

The subsidiary indication is suggesting that takeaway food would be TO GO.
"
14872,Two fantasies involving twenty French hunks basically doing everything you want,LIVING THE DREAM,"Definition: doing everything you want
I think this is an insertion of VINGT (‘twenty French’) and H in LIE and DREAM, ‘two fantasies’. I’m slightly uncomfortable with ‘basically’ as a first letter indicator (if indeed I have parsed it correctly) and with the fact that VINGT and H are in fact inserted into only one fantasy, the first one.

A charade of TAP and AS gives you the Spanish nibbles (well, okay, posh nibbles).

"
14878,Finally realise who in Brussels said it’s indefinite,EQUIVOCAL,"Definition: indefinite
Setters have had some stuff to work with given all this Brexit malarkey, haven’t they? A charade of E for the last letter of ‘realise’, QUI, and VOCAL. There are three official languages in Belgium, and Brussels is essentially bilingual, so QUI as the French word for ‘who’ works perfectly well to allow the setter to get ‘Brussels’ into the surface.
"
14879,Dean for one is creakiest when well-oiled,ICE,"Definition: Dean for one
-SKATERanagram of CREAKIEST; Referencing Christopher Dean, the skater who partnered Jayne Torvill. Their gold medal winning, maximum points performance to Ravel’s *Boléro* in Sarajevo in 1984 is a thing of great beauty.

"
14889,Rider bears unpleasant smell that camels have,HUMPS,"Definition: that camels have
Since it’s a down clue, HUM over PS. The setter might cop some criticism from the cryptic grammar police about the way the definition is written.
"
14890,Strong pot – perhaps from Amsterdam range,DUTCH OVEN,"Definition: Strong pot
The reference is to drugs, but the kitchenware is indeed a ‘strong pot’, and Dutch is whimsically suggesting it might be part of a range of such items from the Netherlands.

14900,Advance under half of ascendant Nigerian’s money,NAIRA,"Definition: money
Clever. Since it’s a down clue, it’s A for ‘advance’ under NAIR for half of ‘Nigerian’ reversed (‘ascendant’). The clever bit is that the the NAIRA is not just any ‘money’, but the currency of Nigeria.

"
14911,where they may be found with choir part set out,ORCHESTRA PIT,"Definition: where they may be found
… who would indeed be found here. It’s anagram of CHOIR PART SET; Less experienced solvers often get bemused by ellipses between clues. The general advice is to ignore them and solve the two clues separately: they are usually there only to allow the setter to link two surfaces to make sense of them, although here Pan is referencing the first clue to point you towards the solution for the second.
"
14912,Plant tree close to stream,BALSAM,"Definition: Plant
The gardening world would definitely not be my specialist subject in the black chair, so a clue with a plant as the answer and a tree in the wordplay is always going to be my LOI. A charade of BALSA and M for the last letter of ‘stream’.

"
14914,Tools used by seamstress finally unnecessary,NEEDLESS,"Definition: unnecessary
A charade of NEEDLES for ‘tools’ and S for the last letter of ‘seamstress’. Needles are of course tools used by a seamstress, but that’s got nothing to do with getting to the answer. The -ess ending to characterise a female profession or position is looking increasingly archaic these days: you hardly ever see *poetess*, *murderess* or *adulteress* these days, and *stewardess* has also been relegated to history, I think. The male (or gender-neutral) word ‘seamster’ is still in dictionaries, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen or heard it myself.
"

An insertion (‘carrying’) of FF in MULE.

A charade of LAND and MINE. ‘Setter’ in a clue, depending on its context, should generally prompt you towards ME, I, MY or MINE. Or, occasionally, the setter’s name, if it’s simple, like Pan or Dac. Carpathian tends not to trouble us in this way.

A charade of a homophone of AIR and LOOM. There can’t be any debate about the homophone, since HEIR is one of the few words in English where the H isn’t aspirate, and which therefore requires ‘an’ rather than ‘a’ as the indefinite article.

The TAU cross, I discovered this morning, is a T-shaped cross (also called St Anthony’s Cross) which is iconic in the Christian tradition.

15208,Across: code given by leaks expert getting hotel for learner?,PIN NUMBER,"Definition: code
Another 1 Across, and one that does my head in. PIN stands for Personal Identification Number, so when the till operator at the supermarket checkout asks ‘Can you just enter your PIN number?’ he is really saying ‘Can you just enter your Personal Identification Number Number?’ Which is a tautology in anybody’s language. The wordplay is clever: Raich is asking you to replace the L (for ‘learner’) in PLUMBER with INN for ‘hotel’.

"
15242,Suppliers of milkshakes not keeping quiet,UDDERS,"Definition: Suppliers of milk
This made me smile, partly because it reminded me of The Farage’s wetting, and partly because it’s funny. If you’ve heard of crossword folk using the term ‘lift and separate’ then this is an example.  You need to do that to ‘milkshake’ so it becomes ‘milk’ and ‘shake’. The first part becomes part of the definition and the second is part of the wordplay. Which is [SH]UDDERS.

A charade of A, PH for the Ordnance Survey abbreviation for Public House, and ASIA. APHASIA is an inability to produce speech, usually as a result of brain damage; hence the reference to 24ac. If I was being picky, I would say that the definition leads to APHASIC.

Another cd cum dd: if you ‘sit on the fence’ you could be ‘hedging’ (your bets).
"
15402,Reason home’s on fire in Paris?,INFER,"Definition: Reason
It’s a pity that the last clue has spoilt a fine debut. I’m afraid this is faulty, unless I’m missing something. The setter is intending a charade of IN for ‘home’ on FER for ‘fire’ in French. Only problem is that the French word for ‘fire’ is FEU, which is (not that it matters) not even a homophone of the word that Skinny is using. FER means ‘iron’.
"
15403,Lecturer parks jeep without bumpers badly,SPEAKER,"Definition: Lecturer
anagram of PARKS [J]EE[P]; The instruction to remove the outside letters – ‘without bumpers’ – fits in seamlessly with the surface reading. The anagrind is ‘badly’.
"
15404,1’s bird?,TWEETER,"Definition: 1’s bird?
This, and 6dn, are cds, and rely on you twigging the fact that the SPEAKER (referenced in 1ac) in question is a part of your hi-fi. TWEETERS handle the high-range frequencies and WOOFERS handle those in the low range.  These two were my LOIs, but cds often are – and once you’d got one, you’d get the other. I got excited briefly about an OPBL, but no deal.
"
15405,Part of Shakespearean range,AREA,"Definition: range
Hidden in ShakespeAREAn.
"
15406,"Cleaner works for Doctors, Casualty and General Hospital?",SOAP OPERAS,"Definition: Doctors, Casualty and General Hospital?

Anto is whimsically suggesting that if you’re as ‘sober as a judge’ you wouldn’t be ‘as drunk as a lord’.
"
15432,Cheers on queen after order demanding silence,OMERTA,"Definition: order demanding silence
A charade of OM for ‘order’ [of merit], ER for Elizabeth Regina, and TA for ‘cheers’. The clue doesn’t really work, because to define OMERTA you need ‘order demanding silence’ and the setter has already used the ‘order’ bit to clue OM.
"
15433,Lab equipment containers tossed into river,TEST TUBES,"Definition: Lab equipment
An insertion (‘into’) of BUTTS reversed in TEES for the NE ‘river’. Not convinced that ‘tossed’ is an appropriate reversal indicator.
"
15434,Poles picked up sound contents in parts of speech,NOUNS,"Definition: parts of speech
An insertion (‘picked up’) of OUN (the middle letters of sOUNd) in NS for the two ‘poles’.
"
15435,Expanded drying material extracted from metal casing,TALCUM POWDER,"Definition: drying material
Well, TALC is hidden in the middle of meTAL Casing, and when you ‘expand’ that to its use as a ‘drying material’ you get TALCUM POWDER (which contains the same element), but I’m not at all persuaded that the clue is unambiguously leading you to the solution. This, like many of this setter’s clues in my opinion, has the feel of ‘that’ll do’.
"
15436,Country wit visited by artist,IRAQ,"Definition: Country
An insertion of RA in IQ.
"
15437,"Lacking leader, Britain is to run riot — for starters",INITIATORS,"Definition: starters

"
15440,"Expert in dealing with gold and silver, perhaps",METALLURGIST,"If someone can explain how this is cryptic, I would be very grateful.
"
15441,"Essentially, clunky chapter is not suitable",UNAPT,"Definition: not suitable
‘Essentially’ generally clues the middle letters of a word, so here it’s [CL]UN[KY] [CH]APT[ER]
"
15442,Exclude benefits outside European range,DOLOMITES,"Definition: European range
An insertion of OMIT in DOLES. This doesn’t work either, because DOLE as ‘benefit’ is invariably singular. You can’t say ‘I’m on the doles.’
"
15443,"On the ground, holding small upright",HONEST,"Definition: upright
An insertion of S in anagram of ON THE; with ‘ground’ as the anagrind.
"
15444,Duke happy after suit delivered,SERVED UP,"Definition: delivered

"
15445,One supporting group trying to find aliens,SETI,"Definition: group trying to find aliens
A charade of SET for ‘group’ over I. SETI stands for Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence. Again, the clue doesn’t really work, because the definition needs ‘group’ and the setter has already used that to clue SET.

A triple definition.
"
15447,Work to be done to make home on carrier,IN TRAY,"Definition: Work to be done

anagram of NOTICE ON DEBUT;
"
15449,How fellows talk openly of a marking system excluding females,MAN TO MAN,"Definition: How fellows talk openlyof a marking systemexcluding females
This looks like another triple definition, although the last one is rather vague.
"

A cd cum dd: the first bit is referencing Mr Hood and the second is a tournament where each team plays against the other at least once.

"

anagram of COSY TALE;
"
15456, SF writer announced when I’m leaving,ASIMOV,"Definition:  SF writer
This clue is also all over the place. ‘Announced’ is a homophone indicator. The three elements of the clue are AS for ‘when’, I’M (which is pronounced IM as in ‘him’ in the writer’s name) and OV, which is meant to be a homophone of OFF. I looked up the pronunciation of the name and it should end in a V sound, but the writer himself accepted that it could be pronounced OFF since it was a transliteration of the family name into the Latin alphabet, done when they emigrated to the US.
"
15457,Boss that is missing when responsibilities are brought up,STUD,"Definition: Boss
A reversal (‘brought up’) of DUT[IE]S.
"
15458,"Russian state’s vice president asked to reply in French, initially",RSVP,"Definition: asked to reply in French

An insertion of COP in HARDY. The insertion indicator is ‘frames’ and the clue is referencing Oliver HARDY, the comedy partner of Stan Laurel.
"
15460,"Desperate Apollo pursued her nymphal elegance, initially",DAPHNE,"Definition: Desperate Apollo pursued her nymphal elegance, initially
The initial letters of the first six words of the clue. It’s a cad: that’s exactly what Apollo did to Daphne in Greek mythology, before she played seriously hard to get and turned into a laurel tree. She wouldn’t get a gig on *Love Island* with that kind of behaviour.

anagram of ALES AGAIN; You can’t have a clearer anagrind than ‘ordered’.
"
15468,They can be won by footballers,SPURS,"Definition: They can be wonfootballers
A dd. SPURS as a football team comes up in Indy crosswords more than it should. You may very well think that’s because the editor is a Tottenham fanatic; I couldn’t possibly comment.
"
15469,The first sign,INITIAL,"Definition: The firstsign
A dd. The second definition is a verb: ‘Can you initial this here, please?’
"
15470,"Country ignores opening of Indiana Jones, perhaps",SURNAME,"Definition: Jones, perhaps

15477,Throw up during field day,ADDLE,"Definition: Throw

"
15478,One Muslim teacher returns carrying egg and cheese for grilling,HALLOUMI,"Definition: cheese for grilling
An insertion of O in I MULLAH, all reversed. O for ‘egg’ is crosswordese, really. Although ‘love’ in tennis is (allegedly) derived from the resemblance of the zero to an egg, which is *l’oeuf* in French.
"
15479,Therefore strange mist causes sickness,ERGOTISM,"Definition: sickness
A charade of ERGO for ‘therefore’ and anagram of MIST; A nasty disease which is the result of poisoning by ergot. Can make your fingers and toes gangrenous, so best avoided, really.

"
15492, ‘Uh’ sound elicited by kitsch wardrobe,SCHWA,"Definition:  ‘Uh’ sound
A rather random surface reading (it’s not putting a picture in my head, put it that way), but it’s hidden (‘elicited’?) in kitSCH WArdrobe. The SCHWA is a short, neutral, generally unstressed vowel sound, represented as an upside down ‘e’ in the International Phonetic Alphabet. It’s extremely common in English, but less so in other European languages. For many speakers, it’s the ‘a’ sound in ‘a book’ or in ‘about’; or the ‘o’ sound in ‘memory’; or the last syllable in ‘father’ (but not if you have a rhotic accent, and let’s not go there, otherwise it’ll be getting dark.) So ‘uh’ is a fair transliteration of it, which is what Everyman has used in his clue.
"

MEDI[T]ATION
"

"
15511,"19, simple-minded one",INNOCENT I,"Definition: 19
This isn’t ideal in any puzzle, let alone a prize one. It would have been helpful to know that we were looking at 19dn and not 19ac, n’est-ce pas? A charade of INNOCENT and I for ‘one’.  He was PONTIFF between 401AD and 417AD. A lack of editing, I think. Oh, hang on, the Everyman series doesn’t have an editor …

This last clue took me the longest time to see. The misdirection is in ‘Hamlet’: it’s naff all to do with the play, but everything to do with its use (uncapitalised) as a noun meaning a small settlement.  It’s THOR[P]. THORP (alternative spelling THORPE) is defined in my Collins as ‘small village’ but it marks it as ‘obsolete except in place names’. Many of which are in 8dn: GRIMETHORPE, FOGGATHORPE, MIDDLETHORPE and a squillion others. Why? Because of the Old Norse/Viking influence in that county: it comes from the Old Norse *thorpe*, meaning ‘village’. Thorp is cognate with modern German *Dorf* (whence Düsseldorf, for example) and modern Dutch *dorp* (whence Hoofddorp). This *d* to *th* shift is very common: brother/*Bruder*, leather/*Leder*, earth/*Erde*, bath/*Bad*. That’s enough consonant shifts for one morning.

An insertion of LID in two Es for the outside letters (‘cover’) of ’employee’. ELIDE can just mean ‘omit’; but I know it better from its use in phonetics, where ELISION refers to leaving out a phoneme in speech. For example, in speech many people would pronounce ‘library’ as ‘libree’. Or ‘Prime Minister’ as ‘Pryminster’. I could think of another pronunciation of our current Prime Minister, but it wouldn’t get past Gaufrid’s blue pencil, I fear.

Two separate insertions of H and HE in anagram of IN AFTER; The anagrind is ‘explosive’ and the insertion indicator is ‘stores’. He was a pioneer in thermometry and the temperature scale is named after him.

"
15858,Horse coming in locates rotten onion,ESCHALOT,"Definition: onion
An insertion of H for ‘horse’ in anagram of LOCATES; gives you the type of onion. Unless someone wants to persuade me otherwise, I think it’s just another name for the SHALLOT. Most folk think of the H=heroin=horse route, but on racing cards h is ‘horse’, g is ‘gelding’, f is ‘filly’, so you can go drug-free if you want.

"
15864,Poem with two lines revised about greeting nightingale,PHILOMEL,"Definition: nightingale
An insertion of HI for the ‘greeting’ in anagram of POEM LL; I was getting excited about an OPBL, but it’s more classics. She’s a minor figure in Greek mythology, so I was never going to know her.

15870,That girl’s suggestion sounded typical of a kid,HIRCINE,"Definition: typical of a kid
This clue stuck out like a sore thumb for me. The rest of the crossword is pretty accessible, but this one is really anything but. HIRCINE means ‘goat-like’ (I learned today). So it’s a homophone (‘sounded’) of HER SCENE (as in ‘it’s not my scene’, I think). I very seldom make a suggestion for a ‘better’ clue, but I might have just clued HEROINE here, because it fits and is less obscure. However, Silvanus has hircine connotations, so who am I to comment?

"
16162,Recorded observations originally left in spaces in registers,ENROLS,"Definition: registers
More first letter indicators: of ‘recorded’ and ‘observations’. These want inserting, along with L, in ENS for the printers’ ‘spaces’. Not to be confused with EMS. In post-lead typesetting days, the terms are still used in em dash and en dash.  In case you’re vaguely interested, I’ve just inserted a hyphen into the previous sentence.  If you want to use dashes for parentheses – like this – then you’ll need an en dash.  Em dashes are sometimes used in books to introduce quotes and are longer, like this —

A charade of OP and PRESS. There are a couple of theories as to why the PRESS is referred to as the ‘fourth estate’.

And while we’re about it, the surface is pretty meaningless.

A charade of S and C for the first letters of ‘servant’ and ‘can’ and anagram of HELP; Chambers tells me that Everyman could have had SCHLEPP or SHLEP had he so wished: the SCH phoneme is the hint that it’s a transliteration from Yiddish. Penguin, Schmenguin …

A dd, referencing the two GEORGIAS – the country and the US state.
"
16927,Actor who’s started to honk a bit?,GOSLING,"Definition: Actor
A whimsical clue, referencing the Canadian actor Ryan GOSLING. Geese honk, but if you’re a baby goose, then you’ve only just started to honk. Geddit?

"
16939,"Either of two writers to be annoying online, unblocked for the most part",TROLLOPE,"Definition: Either of two writers
A charade of TROLL and OPE[N]. Plenty of authors this morning: here you need both Anthony (1815-1882) of *Chronicles of Barsetshire* fame, and Joanna (1943 -), whose works have been described as Aga Sagas. She doesn’t like the term, claims that only two of her many novels feature an Aga and that you can also find themes of lesbianism, broken families and adoption in her work. And all that in rural England while the vicar’s round for tea. She is Anthony’s fifth-generation niece, don’t you know.
"
16940,Where prince said he could be seen running (with no hint of running),WOKING,"Definition: Where prince said he could be seen
This clue is going to date quickly, but I care less – it’s funny. You need to take R for the first letter (again) of ‘running’ out of WORKING for ‘running’. So it’s WO[R]KING. It’s referring to Prince Andrew’s car crash interview with Emily Maitlis after he became embroiled in the affair of the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. He claimed that on the evening in question, he could have been seen at the Pizza Express in Woking with one of his daughters, so couldn’t have been, as alleged, shagging a seventeen-year-old, trafficked American girl in Ghislaine Maxwell’s flat. Yer, right.

"

Tees will often throw you a bit of Classics. ACTAEON was a huntsman in Greek mythology who was transformed into a deer and torn to death by his own dogs. Life was tough back then. A charade of ACT and AEON. ‘Over’ works to give you the word order because it’s a down clue.

-MARIEAn insertion of anagram of A MAN I; in BRIE. The insertion indicator is ‘to tuck into’ and the anagrind is ‘prepared’. The culinary device is a French borrowing, literally meaning ‘Mary’s Bath’. The great invention that is the internet tells me that the derivation is from Mary the Jewess, an ancient alchemist, but it doesn’t seem very sure. In the unlikely event that you want to write about more than one of them, you’ll need *bains-marie*.
"
16976,Organ is in concluding part of performance,FINIS,"Definition: concluding part of performance

"
16986,Author of Blood very keen to return to Lima,GORE VIDAL,"Definition: Author
I can’t quite get this to parse. GORE for ‘Blood’ is fine; very keen is presumably AVID; and the phonetic alphabet gives you L for ‘Lima’. But to get VIDA from AVID requires you move the first letter to the end, and I’m not convinced ‘return’ tells you to do that. ‘Cycle’ might. Happen someone has a better explanation.
"
16987,Speculate about Queen’s headgear,BERET,"Definition: headgear
An insertion of ER in BET.
"
16988,Tavern getting hold of popular vegetable,AUBERGINE,"Definition: vegetable
An insertion of IN for ‘popular’ in AUBERGE. A word English has lifted from French (perhaps best known to tourists in *auberge de jeunesse* for ‘youth hostel’). But the second part is cognate with Old English *beorg*, meaning ‘shelter’, from which we get the second half of HARBOUR.
"
16989,Damp home for China’s last chairman’s supporter?,MAOIST,"Definition: chairman’s supporter?
An insertion (‘home for’) of A for the last letter of ‘China’ in MOIST. China isn’t needed for the definition, but it might have pushed you in the right direction.

A charade of a homophone of SINNER and BAR. Shall we eschew a discussion about SINNER not being a homophone of CINNA for those with rhotic pronunciation? It’s a homophone for many careful speakers of English and this is a crossword.

A charade of K and NIT.
"
16996,Ordered a Republican to rank Democrat,ARRANGED,"Definition: Ordered
A charade of A, R, RANGE and D.
"
16997,Arsonist originally restricted by appropriate court order,FIAT,"Definition: court order
I was so into French borrowings that I stupidly put FAIT here to start with, which knackered me for CRIBBAGE. It is still A for the first letter of ‘arsonist’ in FIT, though; but its derivation is Latin, not French.

Hidden reversed in specuLATIVe.
"
17006,"Lockdown enforcer endlessly complained, unfortunately",POLICEMAN,"Definition: Lockdown enforcer
This is the first crossie reference to the current crisis that I personally have seen. I think setters understandably have shied away from it. But it’s a good surface and clue: it’s anagram of COMPLAINE[D];
"
17007,"Group in a right state, primarily worried about the end of Europe?",REMAINERS,"Definition: Group in a right state, primarily worried about the end of Europe?
Ah, Brexit. Remember that? Setters certainly didn’t avoid that as a reference point for clues. I withdraw my ‘nothing to frighten the horses’ comment for this clue, because it was only on the point of posting the blog and going to the ‘ask the audience’ option that I finally saw how it parses.  It’s a charade of REM for the [pop] group, then E for the last letter of ‘Europe’ inserted into (IN A R S).  The insertion indicator is ‘about’; the anagrind is ‘worried’; the first letter indicator is ‘primarily’; and it’s a cad.
"
17008,Mercenary pair of Nationalists securing international agreement in Berlin,NINJA,"Definition: Mercenary
An insertion of I in N and N followed by JA, the German word for ‘yes’.
"
17009,Messy affairs bothered like-minded people,BIRDS OF A FEATHER,"Definition: like-minded people

17010,Pub meal main oddly lacking taste,UMAMI,"Definition: taste
The even letters of p**U**b**M**e**A**l**M**a**I**n. Only four tastes were recognised when I were a lad: salt, sour, sweet and bitter; but in 1990 it was ‘officially’ recognised as the fifth.

A homophone of CHILLY. I thank the setter sincerely for placing the homophone indicator (‘when picked up’) in a position that leads unequivocally to the answer.

A charade of MISSION and ARIES for the ‘sign’ of the zodiac. The missionary position could be considered ‘standard’ (other positions are available) but I don’t think you can really describe two people copulating in this fashion as MISSIONARIES. And the idea that it came from 19th century missionaries’ disgust with finding ‘primitive’ people engaging in retrocopulation is an urban myth. It first appears in dictionaries in the mid-1960s.
"
17042,Japanese hottie lived with a Guys and Dolls fan,WASABI,"Definition: Japanese hottie
More sensitive solvers might find this offensive on more than one level, but I’ll leave it at that. WASABI is made from Japanese horseradish, hence ‘Japanese hottie’. The parsing is WAS for ‘lived’ and A BI for ‘Guys and Dolls fan’, or more precisely the ‘B’ bit of LGBT.

A charade of EX, TEMP and the initial letters of the last three words of the clue. Broken down into its Latin roots, it would be written EX TEMPORE, but every dictionary I’ve consulted gives only EXTEMPORE as the spelling; so I think the enumeration given here is wrong.

17066,Dish including cheese: sag of the bum to come back round,LASAGNA,"Definition: Dish including cheese
It certainly does contain cheese, so we can’t say the definition wasn’t precise. It’s SAG inserted into ANAL (‘of the bum’) reversed.

New word time for me – not for the answer, but the route to it. My LOI: it more or less had to be BEDLAM, and the ‘heart transplant’ instructions were clear enough. So my route to parsing it was to stick BE??AM into my wordsearch of choice, and, like magic, up came BELDAM. Out with lifting device and magnifying glass, and the old technology that is my SOED says:

A Spoonerism of TIN SAX. This was a tricky clue (some might say for an ‘easy end’ puzzle unnecessarily so).

anagram of NICE SPEECH MAMAS; Unless I am completely off-piste, I think we may be straying into risqué territory here, which is a slight surprise, since I’m sure the setter won’t mind me remarking that Raich is no Harry Hoskins. The solution to 21ac is THE MORNING AFTER, and I can only imagine that we are being invited to imagine the scenario of waking up next to somebody that you don’t remember having gone to bed with, and thinking that it’s probably a good idea to make a hasty exit before you remember whether you did actually exchange bodily fluids the night before. Happy to be corrected.

A cd. The letters in ‘chintz’ are in ALPHABETICAL order.

17367,Neat feature in place to retire. Guy’s niche?,HOSPITAL CORNER,"Definition: Neat feature in place to retire
This took me as long to solve as the rest of the puzzle put together. It’s a way of folding bed sheets so that the sheet remains secure, but easy to replace; I had never heard of it.

17376,"Delivery with keeper initially missing, run yielded, cricket’s shameful, concerning",C,"Definition: Delivery
-SECTIONA slightly rambling, but indubitably cricket-related, surface; as is the way of Crosswordland, the solution is five-eighths of naff all to do with cricket. So consequently a slightly rambling explanation of the parsing: you need to remove the K anagram of ‘keeper initially missing’) and the R (‘run yielded’) from CRICKETS, then anagram it (‘shameful’), then add ON for ‘concerning’. So a charade of (C[R]IC[K]ETS; and ON.

17382,"Primarily, big English opus wherein Unferð loses face?",BEOWULF,"Definition: big English opus wherein Unferð loses face?
If you are a regular Everyman solver, then you will have seen this as your ‘gimme’ to start the gridfill. The first letters of the last seven words of the clue. It’s also a cad (or caddish, if you prefer to ignore the first particle): Unferð is a minor character in the Anglo-Saxon saga *Beowulf*, who impugns the protagonist and is then put down by him. Everyman has kept the Old English *eth* at the end of his name. It is modernised to Unferth (or sometimes Hunferth), which is how the consonant is pronounced. It’s still used in modern Icelandic and if you are using Windows sitting at a keyboard with a numeric keypad, you can create it by holding down ALT and then pressing 0240.

The even letters of dOoHiCkEy reversed. Our American contributors to Fifteensquared sometimes comment about being unfamiliar with Britishisms (and are normally told to suck it up); now the boot is on the other foot, since ‘doohickey’ is American English for what Brits call a 22dn.

Liverpool are Premier League ‘champions’ and their fans’ anthem is this song, originally from the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical *Carousel* (although not a lot of people know that).

This is clued fairly, but in a sufficiently complicated way that you were, I fancy, unlikely to get it cryptically from the get-go.

Another convoluted construction. ‘Half-hearted’ is inviting you to turn RUNNER into RUNER; ‘head dropping’ (since it’s a down clue) is inviting you to turn that into URNER; ‘Farah starts’ is inviting you to put MO at the front of that. ‘Keen’ I am familiar with as a (mainly Scottish?) word for ‘weep’ or ‘wail’, particularly in a lament; dipping into Chambers for the third time this morning I find that a ‘keener’ is a ‘professional mourner’.

"
17766,"Announce new king, accepting Charles I as a kind of power",NUCLEAR,"Definition: a kind of power
An insertion of C in NU and LEAR. The insertion indicator is ‘accepting’; the homophone indicator is ‘announce’, which gets you from ‘new’ to NU; the ‘king’ is the Bard’s; and you have to read ‘Charles I’ as ‘Charles the First’ to give you the C. Cultists of He Who Must Be Obeyed won’t like the last bit, but it’s fine by me.
"
17767,"When this is done, you’ll have flogged round empty vehicle",SOLVED,"Definition: When this is done
When this is done, you will have SOLVED the Quiptic. An insertion of VE in SOLD. The insertion indicator is ’round’ and ’empty’ is inviting you to remove the middle letters of ‘vehicle’, which leaves you with VE.
"
17768,Revolutionary Leninist before the start of glasnost paying attention …,LISTENING,"Definition: paying attention
A charade of anagram of LENINIST; and G for the first letter of ‘glasnost’. Cultists will be less upset by this first letter indication.
"
17769,"ran, half-witted, after Trotsky axed broadcaster",TROTTED,"Definition: ran
A charade of TROT and TED. If you ‘axe’ SKY, the ‘broadcaster’, from TROT[SKY] you get your first element; if you use only half of [WIT]TED you get your second. The ellipses between the clues can be ignored (as they almost always can). They are there just there to run the two clues together to make a better surface.
"
17770,Doctors treat nine men before start of the fun,ENTERTAINMENT,"Definition: fun
A charade of anagram of TREAT NINE; MEN and T for the first letter of ‘the’. I don’t think you can have ‘doctors’ as an anagrind though. ‘Doctor’ as an imperative, or ‘doctored’ as an adjectival past participle, would work, but of course then the setter is bollocksed with the surface reading.
"
17771,Organised moving fifteen to room 101,EFFICIENT,"Definition: Organised
An insertion of CI for the Roman numerals for ‘101’ in anagram of FIFTEEN; The anagrind is ‘moving’ and the insertion indicator is ‘to room’.

17774,Try fish skinned by German for this dish,RISOTTO,"Definition: dish
A charade of R, IS and OTTO. ‘Skinned’ is inviting you to remove the outside letters of the first two words of the clue, so [T]R[Y] and [F]IS[H]. OTTO is the stereotypical ‘German’, often to be found in a bar enjoying a quiet drink with his French friend RENE and his Scottish pal IAN, just waiting for a setter to drop in to ask if she can borrow one of them for a bit.
"
17775,Doctors nabbing our wild parties!,GROUPS,"Definition: parties

17781,Strange hymn about leaders of old men’s organisation — it sounds the same,HOMONYM,"Definition: it sounds the same
An insertion of OMO for the first letters of the sixth, seventh and eighth words of the clue in anagram of HYMN; The anagrind is ‘strange’. HOMONYMS are – broadly speaking – words that are either homographs (spelt identically, pronounced differently: *lead is a metal/Boris is trying to lead the country*) or homophones (spelt differently, sound the same: *it’s going to rain/try to rein in your enthusiasm*). However, at a technical level, linguists disagree about these broad definitions. For the purposes of the argument which the setter is going to get about 1dn in this puzzle, everybody in crosswordland uses ‘homophone’.
"
17782,Old lady returning with Heather into country,AMERICA,"Definition: country
A charade of AM for MA reversed and ERICA, which is the Latin name for the genus of ‘heather’ that you find on a moor. If you are a newer solver, this comes up often, so is worth remembering.
"

A charade of REMOTE for ‘distant’ and CONTROL for ‘run’.
"
17784,Facts show boxing master’s position,CIRCUMSTANCES,"Definition: Facts

A charade of E and NUMERATE.
"
17791,Audibly recognise certain beach,SEASHORE,"Definition: beach
A homophone (‘audibly’) of SEE and SURE. No-one can disagree with the first element; for the second, it depends on your accent. It definitely doesn’t work for me (I’m a Geordie, go figure); it probably does for the Queen. For me (and most solvers, I think) the clue is fine, because it leads you to the answer. Many homophones are accent-dependent, so I read homophone indicators as ‘sounds like this for at least some English speakers’, because then I can sleep at night. You may choose to think otherwise.
"
17792,Dark brush changing hands,GLOOM,"Definition: Dark
Carpathian is inviting you to replace the R in GROOM with L.
"

"
17809,"Labour retains original manifesto, initially creating disquiet",TURMOIL,"Definition: disquiet
An insertion (‘retains’) of UR and M for the first letter of ‘manifesto’ in TOIL. Not to be confused with UR for the ancient Mesopotamian city, UR for ‘original’ is of German origin (it’s pronounced the same as *die Uhr*, for ‘clock’, or for telling the time). In German, it’s reasonably common: *die Urbevölkerung* (*Ur* plus *Bevölkerung*) for ‘original people’ or ‘indigenous population’; *die Urzeit* (*Ur* plus *Zeit*) for ‘original time’ or ‘prehistoric times’. It’s not widely used in English: the best example I have found is Ur-civilisation for ‘the beginning of civilisation’. Perhaps someone has a better or more common example.

anagram of VR MAN CITED SOME; with ‘funny’ as the anagrind and ‘extremely’ inviting you to use only the outside letters of ‘vulgar’.

"
17814,Not very smart? That’s rather unfair,A BIT THICK,"Definition: Not very smartThat’s rather unfair
A dd. The second definition comes from ‘laying it on a bit thick’, which I suppose is where the ‘excess’ or ‘unfair’ allusion comes from.

The setters’ favourite muse by a country mile. A charade of E, RA and TO.

A charade of NA for ‘sodium’, CELL and E. ‘Covers’ works because it’s a down clue. The housing which forms the outer casing of an engine, and vaguely familiar to this solver from assembling Airfix aircraft kits in the 1960s. The high from the polystyrene cement was awesome.
"
17822,"Popular recording grabbing one, volume is turned up",DEMOTIC,"Definition: Popular
An insertion (‘grabbing’) of I and TOME in CD for ‘recording’, all reversed.
"
17823,Parody mostly is on right track,SPOOR,"Definition: track

"
17824,Promise to include perhaps Milton Keynes’s last regressive therapist,OSTEOPATH,"Definition: therapist
An insertion (‘to include’) of POET and S for the last letter of ‘Keynes’, reversed, in OATH. The 17th century poet best known for *Paradise Lost*.
"
17825,Slavery unlikely to be found around Croatia,THRALL,"You learn stuff from crossies. My learning today was that HR is the ISO country code for Croatia, derived from its local name, Hrvatska, and that you need to insert that into TALL for ‘unlikely’ to give you a word meaning ‘slavery’.
"
17826,"Musician, 6, appearing with Solti in Brahms and Liszt",VIOLINIST,"Nowt to do with 6dn or 6ac, but rather the Roman numeral.

Klingsor’s intention here was clearly to lead the solver up the garden path. He succeeded in this house this morning, and a very long path it proved. 3 is indeed the CUBE ROOT of 27, because 3³ is 27. anagram of CUE TO ROB;
"

[D]ISRAEL[I]
"
17831,"Unmarried German 14, say",UTTER,"Definition: say
Another musical clue. Here you do need to reference 14dn. Anne-Sophie MUTTER is a celebrated and very talented German violinist. She has been married, most recently to André Previn, but if she were unmarried cryptically it would result in [M]UTTER.
"
17832,Noble‘s heading for birthday party,BRAVE,"Definition: Noble
A charade of B for the first letter of ‘birthday’ and RAVE, the sort of ‘party’ that you shouldn’t be attending at the minute. Remember, only the current Government and Dominic Cummings are allowed to break the law.

The surface is a bit meaningless, but it’s a charade of MAN and anagram of KEEPS NAMETAG; MANAGEMENT SPEAK (aka corporate jargon, or less kindly, business bullsh*t) is certainly irritating, but ‘core competencies’ is not the worst I’ve ever come across. ‘Are we all on the same page?’ (13 across). ‘Let’s touch base offline’ (you mean you want to meet up in person?). ‘We need to shoot the puppy’ (no, no).

17862,Speed trap?,MOTORMOUTH,"Definition: Speed trap?
A cd, which took me a while to see even once I’d written the answer in. A MOTORMOUTH is someone who talks quickly and incessantly, so it’s a play on the fact that ‘trap’ is a slang word for ‘mouth’.

An insertion of MI (as in MI5 or MI6) and COL for ‘colonel’ in SE for ‘Kent’ (Kent being in the south-east of England) and ON for one of the ‘sides’ in cricket. A SEMICOLON is one of the ‘stops’ in punctuation. I am on a personal mission to become less enraged (ideally, not enraged at all) when people misuse it. George Orwell eschewed it completely in *Coming Up for Air; *he allegedly reckoned that it was too middle class. Kurt Vonegutt had this advice: ‘First rule: Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you’ve been to college.’ A tad harsh, I think.

17877,Human beings in graceless state,MORTAL SIN,"Definition: graceless state
The boy is on fire with crisp and succinct surfaces this morning. This one’s for the left-footers in the audience. It’s a charade of MORTALS and IN, and the ‘graceless state’ is where, according to Catholic theology, you will be if you commit a MORTAL SIN, because – being a grave action, committed with the sinner’s full consent and knowledge – it automatically leads to a separation of the sinner from God’s redeeming grace. Repentance in the confessional is your get-out-of-jail card. I checked out what currently constitutes a mortal sin according to the Holy See, and self-pleasuring is still in there, which is good to know.

A charade of CUR and a homophone of PHEW! The homophone indicator is ‘picked up’. The word has an interesting etymology. Middle English nicked it from from Old French *cuevrefeu*, which has hardly changed in modern French, which is *le couvre-feu*, literally ‘cover fire’. It’s related to regulations which required people to extinguish fires at a fixed hour in the evening, often with the ringing of a bell.

An insertion of N in CANE followed by two Ls for ‘lines’, O and IN for ‘popular’ reversed.
"
18214,Daughter takes rent for weed,DRIP,"Definition: weed
A charade of D and RIP. I don’t think this works, because the equivalent of RIP as a verb is ‘rend’, as in ‘What God has put together, let no man rend asunder’. ‘Rent’ is the simple past and past participle of ‘rend’, so you can’t have ‘rent’ as the equivalent of RIP.

If you were ‘no distance’ from the river that forms The Backs at Cambridge, then you could find yourself in a CAM O MILE place.
"
18231,Keep going for Just a Minute,HOLD ON,"Definition: Keep goingJust a Minute
A dd, but not a great clue because HANG ON works just as well, and was the option I chose, which knackered me for a bit with the intersecting down clue.  Just a Minute should really be italicised, since it’s a long-running panel game on BBC radio.
"
18232,Nervous of operating something sharp,ON EDGE,"Definition: Nervous
A charade of ON and EDGE. Not all edges are sharp, of course.

A rather whimsical cd cum dd: you could describe your ‘pet project’ as your ‘baby’, and if you demonstrated it, then you’d be a BABY SHOWER. An American tradition which sadly – along with gender reveal parties – seems to moving eastwards to these islands. That said, I shouldn’t be so grumpy, since the tradition – or something similar – exists in many cultures, including ancient ones.

"
18302,"Son-in-law rising, holding a wine cocktail, feels exhilarated",WALKS ON AIR,"Definition: feels exhilarated
An insertion of SON in LAW reversed and A inserted into KIR. The reversal indicator is ‘rising’; the two insertion indicators are ‘in’ and ‘holding’. KIR is a mixture of dry white wine (typically Burgundy) and *crème de cassis*; the clue is a rather tortuous set of instructions to give you the solution, which I am not fully convinced I have understood properly.

I can’t parse this satisfactorily, I’m afraid. If the last three words were absent, it would work as A LICE BAND plus S for ‘second’. But I can’t explain the ‘on top’ instruction. I’m sure someone will come to my rescue.

A charade of RED and TAPE. Similarly, RED TAPE is not a good definition of ‘you’ll need to fill in a form’.

"
18308," Anxious to be part of Gog and Magog, however things go",AGOG,"Definition:  Anxious
‘Anxious’ for AGOG? ‘Excited’, ‘eager’, ‘curious’, for sure. But ‘anxious’? Probably not. And the subsidiary indicator is not great, if I understand it well – simply that GOG is included in both ‘Gog’ and ‘Magog’. And the surface is pretty pants too. So if you’re getting a hint that I wasn’t that impressed with 21dn, you’re in the right area.
"

An insertion of NOW in SY for the abbreviation for ‘Seychelles’. The clue is fine, but I will just reflect that Christmases are *very* rarely snowy in most parts of the UK these days.

And while I’m having a chunter, the robin is an all year round resident of this country and doesn’t just appear perched on spade handles with 5cm of snow on top.

The final particle is a skin ‘growth’ or cyst, and is most often found in the archaic and somewhat derogatory term for London, The Great Wen. I mentioned it in one of my blogs a few weeks ago and nobody seemed that bothered about it, but I’m not persuaded that L for ‘long’ works. L for ‘length’, for sure.

A dd, with the second element being an informal expression for being pregnant. There are still half a dozen English speakers on the planet who object to the equivalence of ‘anticipate’ and ‘expect’, but its usage is common now even among careful writers. Like me.
"
18838,"Several getting by, supported by deliveries repeatedly",MANY TIMES OVER,"Definition: repeatedly

A cd. The reference is found in Genesis 37:3: ‘Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.’ Which of course isn’t the same Joseph who was the carpenter, husband of Mary and a walk-on part in the nativity story. So the clue doesn’t really work, for me anyway. Most folk would have got there through recognising the musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, *Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat*. Which is about the Old Testament character.
"
18850,"Press pitch regularly ignored, which is funny",IRONIC,"Definition: funny
A charade of IRON for ‘press’ and IC for the even letters of ‘pitch’.
"
18851,Woman showing compassion in a Beirut hotel,RUTH,"Definition: Woman showing compassion

18859,Numbers intended to be heard by more; words intended to be heard by fewer,A,"Definition: Numbers intended to be heard by morewords intended to be heard by fewer
-SIDESIt took me a while to see this, but when I did realise that it was a dd, I liked it a lot for the brevity and contrast of its surface. A-SIDES, referencing a vinyl disc (they’re making a comeback) would be the ones you’d listen to first, since they had the ‘hit’ on them (*cf* B-SIDES); ASIDES in a theatre are meant to be heard by the audience, but not the other characters on stage.
"
18860, Stretchy base: perhaps Tupperware loses lid,ELASTIC,"Definition:  Stretchy
A charade of E and [P]LASTIC. The number **e** is a mathematical constant which is the ‘base’ for a logarithm; Tupperware is such a common trademark that I think Everyman is entitled to use it as a synonym for ‘plastic’, particularly since he has prefaced it with ‘perhaps’.
"
18861,Honouring monarch around end of day,KNIGHTING,"Definition: Honouring
An insertion of NIGHT in KING. The insertion indicator is ‘around’.

A dd.
"
18864, Health Secretary who reluctantly gave blood?,HANCOCK,"Definition:  Health Secretarywho reluctantly gave blood?
A potential non-starter for overseas solvers, since it’s very much a UK-centric clue. It’s a dd: the two HANCOCKS are Matt Hancock, currently the UK Health Secretary in the Conservative government, and Tony Hancock, the comedian who died by suicide way back in 1968. The latter was very famous in his day, however, and his blood donor sketch has become a classic. ‘I don’t mind giving a reasonable amount, but a pint! That’s very nearly an armful!’

18875,It’s used for plastic coating‘: what Macbeth wanted to hear?,URETHANE,"Definition: It’s used for plastic coating
URETHANE is a compound which in liquid form is used, among other things, as a coating. The Shakespearean reference is to the fact that Macbeth was the Thane of Glamis, and then the Thane of Cawdor, so in an act of status confirmation, might want to be told ‘You’re a thane’ (which is a homophone of the solution). Thane is derived from the Old English word *þegn*, meaning ‘servant’ or ‘attendant’, but in the play’s context it means a man who holds land from a Scottish king.

A cad? Sir Keir, certainly not; but the clue? Depends on your political leanings, I guess. Apart from having a first name that breaks the ‘i before e except when it isn’t’ rule, his main achievement seems to have been to persuade folk that he’s not Jeremy Corbyn. We get that now.

18949,"To kick off with, paneer and kofta. Alternatively, a …",PAKORA,"A charade of P, A and K for the initial letters of ‘paneer’, ‘and’ and ‘kofta’, OR and A.  The definition is a whimsical one: all three foods are of Indian origin, so if you didn’t fancy the first two, you might opt for the third one, which is the solution and might appear after the ellipsis.
"
18950,Butt piercing annoys hipsters,TRENDIES,"Definition: hipsters
An insertion of END in TRIES.  The insertion indicator is ‘piercing’.
"
18951,Heart medication immediately starts to induce nausea,STATIN,"Definition: Heart medication

18966,Scoundrel downing good Beaujolais?,ROUGE,"Definition: Beaujolais?
An insertion of G in ROUÉ.  The question mark is there because it’s a definition by example.  I know ROUÉ, but was minded to look into its etymology.  It comes from the French word for ‘wheel’, *une roue*.  Originally, it literally meant ‘broken on a wheel’, referring to the instrument of torture thought to be deserved by such a person.  Slightly harsh.

A charade of B, ROME and anagram of LAID; with ‘out’ as the anagrind. Plants are an empty room in my mind palace, so I was happy enough with BROMELIDA before the crossing letters put me right.

anagram of CRAMPS OIL;
"
19009,"Member of Steps, Beatle wife, 60s diva assembled somewhere in C Pacific",HONOLULU,"Definition: somewhere in C Pacific
This is a much better surface, although 60s needs an apostrophe after it to get past the punctuation police. H is a member of the pop group Steps; ONO is John Lennon’s wife; LULU is a 1960s’ diva. Put them together and you’ve got the capital of Hawaii, which is in the Central Pacific.

19010,Some ‘hero’ haltingly retiring somewhere in Asia,LAHORE,"Definition: somewhere in Asia
Somewhere in the Central Pacific, somewhere in Asia … we’ll be somewhere Over the Rainbow soon. Hidden reversed in hERO HALtingly. Do we really need the inverted commas around ‘hero’?

A reverse anagram thingy. Since ‘ground’ is an anagrind, GATHERS GROUND would clue ‘the rags’.
"
19014,The French defending one supporting mob – there’s some nerve!,GANGLIA,"Definition: some nerve
A charade of GANG and I inserted into LA for one of the French words for ‘the’. The insertion indicator is ‘defending’ and ‘supporting’ works because it’s a down clue. I am struggling to make the clue really work, since GANGLIA is the plural of GANGLION, and ‘some nerve’ to describe a plural entity is perhaps not ideal.
"
19015,"Primarily, Thomas Edison’s science-advancing, long-standing arch-rival!",TESLA,"Definition: Primarily, Thomas Edison’s science-advancing, long-standing arch-rival!
The initial letters of the second to sixth words of the clue and a (very vague) cad. One of Edison’s many inventions was the electric light bulb, but to describe him as a ‘rival’ of the EV company TESLA is a stretch.

A charade of SATS and UMA. SATS (more correctly written as SATs) stands for Standard Assessment Tests. They are used in English primary schools to evaluate pupils’ progress at the end of Y2 and Y6.

"
19023,"A little manic, Ollie Reed portrays man seen with canary",COLLIER,"Definition: man seen with canary
Another hidden: this time in maniC OLLIE Reed. I’m not sure the actor Oliver Reed was ever widely called ‘Ollie’, but many of his character portrayals could be described as ‘manic’. My favourite of his is as Gerald Crich, the mine owner in Russell’s adaptation of D H Lawrence’s *Women in Love*. The canary reference is to the mines, of course: the birds were taken down by miners because they would react more quickly than colliers to high levels of carbon monoxide, thus providing an early warning of danger. I was surprised to learn that in the UK it was only in 1986 that they were replaced by electronic monitors.
"

He’s quaint, reassuringly middle-class and has been in the *Daily Express* for over a century, so don’t knock him.
"
19033,Mary Wilson perhaps unsurpassed,SUPREME,"Definition: Mary Wilson perhapsunsurpassed
Say Mary Wilson to me and, being a boomer, I’m going straight to Harold’s wife (and an established poet), but for the dd Tees is offering here she was also one of the founding members of The Supremes.

A charade of HOTPOT and ATO for the odd letters of AuThOr.
"
19041,Chuck down at least sixteen feet of water?,RAIN CATS AND DOGS,"A kind of cd, I guess, if you insist on categorising all answers.

A charade of H and [R]USTLER. H for ‘horse’ works with the ‘heroin’ correspondence; but someone was saying the other day on another blog that it’s also a common abbreviation on racecards, distinguishing a runner from a colt, or a filly (or something like that – I know naff all about racing).

The initial letters of the last five words of the clue. Not a definition that I had come across before, but our US friends will have been in familiar territory. Collins has:
"
19156,No leads on the water boiler?,HEATER,"Definition: boiler?
Another clue I especially liked, for its brevity and meaningful surface. [T]HE [W]ATER.
"
19157, Force vehicle to speed up after Petty Officer left in charge,POLICE CAR,"Definition:  Force vehicle
A charade of PO, L, IC and RACE reversed.  ‘Up’ as the reversal indicator works because it’s a down clue.
"
19158,"Copper replaces one, making patrol complete",UNCUT,"Definition: complete
Another replacement clue: here Bluth is inviting you to replace the I in UNIT for ‘patrol’ with CU.
"
19159, Best phone company accepts ninety pounds,EXCEL,"Definition:  Best
A charade of XC for the Roman numerals for ‘ninety’ in EE for the mobile phone company and L. ‘Best’ as a verb (which we need here) is for me more ‘outwit’ or ‘outdo’; I’m not sure it’s the same thing as EXCEL.
"
19160,Looked like Greeks regularly exploited space up top,RESEMBLED,"Definition: Looked like
A charade of RES for the even letters of ‘Greeks’, EM for the printers’ ‘space’ and BLED. ‘Up top’, because it’s a down clue, tells you the order of the particles.

A charade of P and LAYER.
"
19163,Likely for highly attractive sort to pick up student,PROBABLE,"Definition: Likely
A charade of PRO and L for ‘student’ (from learner driver plates) inserted into BABE. Had this clue appeared in Another Place, there would, I fancy, have been a flurry of indignation about the use of BABE in this sense. We’re about to find out whether Indy solvers are quite so sensitive. It’s in *Chambers* …
"
19164, Share with journalist,WHACK,"Definition:  Share
A charade of W and HACK. ‘She got a fair whack/share of the money left in her parents’ will.’
"
19165, Outlaw speed bumps on bendy road,DESPERADO,"Definition:  Outlaw

19175,"Put otherwise, ‘anon’; also, dishearteningly, ‘mere’!",NO,"Definition: Put otherwise, ‘anon’; also, dishearteningly, ‘mere’!
-NAMEanagram of ANON ME; The anagrind is ‘put otherwise’. I am not convinced ‘dishearteningly’ is grammatically correct to tell us to remove the central letters of ‘mere’. ‘Disheartened’ would work (but not for the surface). A rather clunky cad.
"
19176,King missing Australia leadenly condemned outlaw,NED KELLY,"Definition: outlaw
anagram of K LE[A]DENLY; The removal indicator is ‘missing’ and the anagrind is ‘condemned’. The surface reading is not putting a picture in my head.
"
19177,What happens when a golfball sliced? Already mentioned,AFORESAID,"Definition:  Already mentioned
I know five-eights of naff all about golf and care less, but surely golfball is two words? I can’t find this version anywhere, and the clue doesn’t rely on it. The clue does rely on the fact that a player will shout ‘Fore!’ to warn others of a mishit shot that is in danger of crowning someone. So you definitely do need to separate out the three words: A FORE SAID.
"
19178,"US territory acceding haltingly, primarily?",UTAH,"Definition: US territory acceding haltingly, primarily?
The initial letters of the first four words of the clue, and a cad, because the final part of the incorporated territory of Utah was only admitted to the Union in 1896.

19191,"Dishes in bistro, finally: ‘Everyman, settle up’ (with slight discrepancy)",OMELETTES,"Definition: Dishes
A charade of O for the last letter of ‘bistro’, ME for the self-referential ‘Everyman’ and LETTES, which is a reversal (nearly) of SETTLE. The fact that a ‘slight discrepancy’ could be lots of things and the surface is borderline meaningless, with punctuation desperately trying to rescue it, means that this was not my favourite clue today.
"
19192,She’s attractive and dangerous seller of foreign food (the French horse),DELILAH,"Definition: She’s attractive and dangerous
A charade of DELI, LA for one of the words for ‘the’ in French, and H for ‘horse’. The last particle could be based on the horse/heroin/H connections; but it’s also used in the equestrian world.

-BEAMA charade of OFF and BEAM.
"
19197,"Not my mistake, putting junk in stable",STATIC,"Definition: stable
An insertion of TAT in SIC. SIC is the Latin term that writers (often journalists quoting others) use to indicate that the spelling or other error in the text is the original writer’s mistake, not theirs.

Think phonetic alphabet. R for ROMEO is five letters after M for Mike.
"
19199,Piece of tin object in the distance,FARTHING,"Definition: Piece of tin

19526,"It needs treatment, rough, for backing protocol row",SAUSAGE WAR,"Definition: protocol row
A very contemporary clue, and one that will disqualify the puzzle for reprinting in the **i** in four years’ time because everyone will have forgotten what it was all about. I’m not convinced it’s a very fair clue, because although I might have seen it briefly as a description in the national press, it’s hardly an established phrase. It’s to do with the fuss about importing meat products from Great Britain into Northern Ireland following Brexit, a consequence of the UK agreeing a binding legal agreement with the EU, proudly boasting there would never be a border in the Irish Sea, and then discovering there was one after all. The WAR bit comes from RAW reversed. The SAUSAGE bit is – I think – just a reference to the fact that sausages are a ‘treated’ meat product.

19882,Star doesn’t go conversing in Spanish,NOVA,"Definition: Star
In Spanish, NO VA means ‘doesn’t go’. But don’t be tempted to mention the mistranslation story about the poorly selling Vauxhall Nova in Spain, or the Chevrolet Nova in Latin America. It never happened. The Vauxhall was sold in Spain as the Opel Corsa from the outset and the Chevy actually sold pretty well in those Spanish-speaking countries. It doesn’t even sound the same in Spanish: the stress in nova and *no va* is different. And in a nod to 17dn, if you wanted to say that a car ‘doesn’t go’ or ‘doesn’t work’, you’d most likely say something like *no funciona*. So no corporate embarrassment, no lost sales. Just a big, fat (but often repeated) urban myth.

19943,Vocalist to improvise around unusual chord – it’s a must-see,SCHR,"Definition: it’s a must-see
ÖDINGER’S CATAn insertion of anagram of CHORD; in SINGER and SCAT. The insertion indicator is ‘around’ and the anagrind is ‘unusual’.  I’m a scientist by education so I know perfectly well what the physicist’s feline is all about, but the definition took a long time to twig. It’s to do with a famous thought experiment involving a cat in a closed box, where – given a property of quantum systems called superposition – the cat can be simultaneously alive *and* dead, until it is observed, when the superposition collapses and the cat is either alive *or* dead. So I am surmising that the ‘must-see’ element of the definition refers to this change of state only occurring when the cat is seen. Which would be an ask even for an averagely scientifically literate solver.
"
19944,Methuselah had to complete a course his boss thought up,IDEATED,"Definition: thought up

An insertion of U and C for the initial letters of ‘unsuccessful’ and ‘coup’ in LIFER, which is someone who would have been ‘sent down for good’. A cad, where the whole clue defines the solution: in the Judeo-Christian tradition, LUCIFER is a fallen angel who desired himself to become God and was cast out of heaven by the same. The account is in Ezekiel, but is reiterated in Luke 10:18: *He replied, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.”*

19952, Tolkien has him following a ring of gold around,FRODO,"Definition:  Tolkien has him following a ring of gold around
Another cad, and a charade of F for ‘following’ and O D’OR reversed (‘around’). There’s no indication that you need the French version of ‘of gold’, and it’s not really that fully engrained in English. Great surface reading, though.  The reference is, of course, to a character in JRR Tolkien’s work, *The Lord of the Rings.*
"
19953,Part of a Halloween tradition where a sucker is made to welcome a little rascal,TREAT,"Definition: Part of a Halloween tradition

19956,Pole gives attack dog the slip and joins two Italians who escaped long ago,HARRY HOUDINI,"Definition: who escaped long ago
Attack dog gives you HARRY HOUND. The setter is asking you to take the N for North (Pole) out of that, insert it between I and I for ‘Italians’ and then join it on to the end. I know, I know, it’s Sunday and we’re not wired up for this sort of stuff.

19962,Priest cracking hints about contents of early cardinal’s tomb,SEPULCHRE,"Definition: tomb
An insertion of P in CLUES reversed followed by [T]HRE[E], which is indeed an early cardinal number. The insertion indicator is ‘cracking’ and the reversal indicator is ‘about’.

[W]ITCH. You have to read ‘wants’ as ‘lacking’.
"
19971,Dress like a folk-tale wolf we’ve heard about,WEAR,"Definition: Dress
First up, I’m not sure WEAR and ‘dress’ are interchangeable in a verbal sense without the addition of a preposition to the latter; you could argue that they are synonymous as nouns. ‘We’ve heard about’ is a homophone indicator for WERE, as in WEREWOLF. Second up, I’m not convinced that the clue really works with ‘like a’ indicating only the first element of the word. The homophone is fine, though: dictionaries give both this pronunciation as well as the one which pronounces the first element the same as the north-east river which snakes round The Stadium of Light.
"
19972,Ultimately obsolete little contraction which we still use occasionally today,EEN,"Definition: Ultimately obsolete little contraction which we still use occasionally today
The final letters of the second, third and fourth words of the clue, and another cad. EEN is short for ‘evening’, and is most often heard in today’s theme, HALLOWEEN, which is derived from ALL HALLOWS’ EVE and was a reverse-engineered Christian creation from November 1st, ALL HALLOWS’ DAY, or ALL SAINTS’ DAY. Originally it was a pagan tradition, based on *Samhain*.

An insertion of D and O for the initial letters of ‘delicious’ and ‘olive’ in MANNA.
"
19990," Jack, who doffs his cap in church space",KNAVE,"Definition:  Jack
I think this is a charade of K and NAVE, with the K coming from [JAC]K and the removal instruction being ‘doffs his cap’. I am happy to be corrected, because if it is this, I don’t think it’s a very clear or fair clue.
"
19991,Cheers after Charlie’s appearance in extravagant production by Italians,RICOTTA,"Definition: production by Italians

I’m afraid I have no idea how to parse this.
"
19998,Arranged denial without asking first,LINED UP,"Definition: Arranged
A reverse anagram. The setter is asking you to read ‘asking first’ as producing the letter A; then you need to remove that from ‘denial’ to give you DENIL; the next step is the reverse anagram, where LINED UP is a clue for DENIL. The surface reading anagrind is ‘arranged’, the reverse anagrind is UP, the removal indicator is ‘without’, and ‘arranged’ is doing double duty as one of the anagrinds and the definition. All very clever, but completely inappropriate for a puzzle intended for beginners and demonstrating a degree of thoughtlessness on the part of the setter and editor.
"
19999,Waves used to make other waves,ROLLERS,"Definition: Wavesused to make other waves
A dd. The second definition is to do with hairdressing.

A charade of FORM, I and C followed by ACID. ‘See’ to indicate the letter C is not one of my favourite constructions, but it’s widely used and accepted. The ‘soldier’ is of course the ant, and many species are able to spray FORMIC ACID as a defence mechanism. Today’s off-topic factoid is that the French word for an ant is *une fourmi*, which is related to this fact.

anagram of NUMBER TEN OKAY; A noun from MOUNTEBANK, for ‘a buffoon, a charlatan, a quack seller of remedies’ (*Chambers*). All of which could be used to describe the current inhabitant of Number Ten, our Great Leader. And liar. Another interesting piece of etymology: the word comes from the Italian imperative *monta in banco!* or climb on the bench! The allusion is to someone climbing onto a raised platform in order to address an audience with false promises. That’d be the platform in the new Number Ten briefing room, normally used by Boris, and where Allegra Stratton found it laugh-out-loud funny to practise her denials of work-related events that didn’t happen anyway.

Intricate but precise wordplay. Since it’s a down clue, ‘circulating mails to support’ tells you to do anagram of MAILS; and put it at the bottom; then you need to take CONFESSION for ‘admission of guilt’ and replace the ‘deception’ or CON with PRO for ‘for’.

A charade of anagram of BOWLER; and MOO reversed. The anagrind is ‘moving’ and the reversal indicator, since it’s a down clue, is ‘looking up’. The solution to 10ac is LEEWAY, whence ELBOW ROOM. I am struggling a bit to exactly equate ‘lower’ and MOO. To MOO is to ‘low’, for sure; and a ‘lower’ is an animal that MOOS. But a MOO is only a cow in babyspeak, so I’m not sure if that’s what Bluth intended.

Again, intricate but precise. An insertion of CODE in anagram of LOST;, all inserted into POTTERY. You could also consider ‘cycling’ as asking you to put the L in ‘lost’ to the end. The two insertion indicators are ‘getting to grips with’ and ‘in’. If you were being cynical about the Tories’ levelling up policy, you could say that it was a POSTCODE LOTTERY, depending on whether the MP in whose constituency postcode you live is sufficiently brown-nosed and obeisant to be granted a place in the queue for the recycled money that is available.

Is a pizza a type of pie? I’m not going there, but you can if you want. If we accept that it is, then this is – unless I am missing something – just a cd, and a rather weak one at that.  Although I do get ‘the spy came in from the cold’ gag.
"
20467,Pope’s support complete for untrue tale,URBAN LEGEND,"Definition: untrue tale
A charade of URBAN, LEG and END. You have eight papal choices for URBAN. Pope Urban II is perhaps best known, since he initiated the first Crusade to the Holy Land, encouraging anyone who would listen to ‘wrest that land from the wicked race’.

A charade of LE for one of the words for ‘the’ in French, and AVE.
"
20513,Animals returning earth’s nitrogen content,LIONS,"Definition: Animals

An insertion of PRO in AN. The insertion indicator is ‘wearing’.
"
20520,Buy a meat loaf stuffed with root vegetable,YAM,"Definition: root vegetable
Hidden in buY A Meat. Some would consider that since ‘loaf’ is not required for the clue to work, it shouldn’t be there. Since ‘meat loaf’ is one concept, I’m reasonably relaxed about it, particularly since the surface is so engaging.

A charade of B and LAZE.
"
20522,Greeting boy in doorway with present,EXHIBIT,"Definition: present

20534,Wrong of panel supporting tax rise,INJURY,"Definition: Wrong
A charade of NI reversed and JURY. The reversal indicator is ‘rise’ and ‘supporting’ gives you the order of the particles. Both work only because it’s a down clue. There’s a bit of that this morning.

"
20539,Somewhere to sleep in Matlock?,MATTRESS,"Definition: Somewhere to sleep

20540,Look! Queues in America for Virgin and EasyJet,AIRLINES,"Definition: Virgin and EasyJet
A charade of AIR and LINES. The ‘in America’ bit is there just to suggest that LINES is more AmEng than BrEng.

An insertion of U and [the Isle of] MAN in HE for His Excellency or ‘ambassador’.
"
20542,Contracted big town dude to come up with scheme,TACTIC,"Definition: scheme
A reversal of CIT[Y] and CAT. The letter removal indicator is ‘contracted’ and the reversal indicator is ‘to come up’, which only works because … well, you’ve got the idea by now. Please let’s not have a fruitless discussion about a ‘scheme’ being a strategy and not a TACTIC. Please.
"
20543,Plonk from French politician,DUMP,"Definition: Plonk
A charade of DU and MP. I’m going to call foul on this one, since DU almost always means ‘from the’ in French (when it’s not doing duty as the partitive article and translating ‘some’). Setters are certainly entitled to use ‘from French’ to clue DE, but DU? Hectence’s only get out of jail card would be with masculine countries like *le Canada*, *le Danemark*: *je viens du Canada*/I come from Canada; *il vient du Danemark*/he comes from Denmark.  Easily solved by rewriting the clue as ‘Plonk from the French politician’.
"

20546,Where Phil Mitchell might have looked for trouble?,MARRIAGE BUREAU,"Definition: Where Phil Mitchell might have looked for trouble?
Even I, who have never watched an episode of *EastEnders* in my life, know that Phil Mitchell is the baddie in the show, so we need to know that ‘trouble and strife’ is cockney rhyming slang for ‘wife’. And that’s it, I think.
"
20547,Soldier joins man touring American country,PARAGUAY,"Definition: country
A charade of PARA and an insertion of A in GUY. The insertion indicator is ‘touring’.

20552,Report of plant garden in London area,SOHO,"Definition: London area
A homophone (‘report’) of SOW and HOE.

Hidden in pOPE RAshly.
"
20557,The first offence in arena of conflict?,CRIMEA,"Definition: arena of conflict?
Whimsically, CRIME A could be the ‘first offence’. Chillingly, CRIMEA is an arena of conflict right now.
"
20558,Working to block protest against end of city state,MONARCHY,"Definition: state
An insertion of ON for ‘working’ in MARCH, followed by Y for the final letter of ‘city’. The insertion indicator is ‘to block’. ‘State’ as a definition of MONARCHY is a bit loose, I fancy.
"
20559,Organised protests arise about new political detainees?,STATE PRISONERS,"Definition: political detainees?
An insertion of N in anagram of PROTESTS ARISE; The anagrind is ‘organised’ and the insertion indicator is ‘about’. A slightly odd phrase: I wouldn’t say I was familiar with it, and searching for it brings up only US state prisoners, who could hardly be called ‘political detainees’.
"
20560,Last arrow female shot in tale of wartime romance,A FAREWELL TO ARMS,"Definition: tale of wartime romance
anagram of LAST ARROW FEMALE; gives you Hemingway’s novel.
"
20561,Went on the radio with opinion representing driver’s need,ROAD SENSE,"Definition: driver’s need
I think this is a homophone (‘on the radio’) of ROWED, or perhaps RODE, followed by SENSE for ‘opinion’. ROWED/RODE is a very broad interpretation of ‘went’ and I’m not sure of the correspondence of the second element. ‘What’s your sense/opinion of the situation?’ perhaps.
"
20562,Leisure centre has accepted poetry pieces on Jack Cade,AMUSEMENT ARCADE,"Definition: Leisure centre
A charade of A, MUSE, MEN, TAR and CADE. A for ‘accepted’? I can’t find it in *Collins* or *Chambers*. Surely a MUSE inspires poetry and is not poetry itself.
"
20563, Country servant plugs film,EGYPT,"Definition:  Country
An insertion of GYP in ET, the ‘film’ beloved of setters. GYP is a term for college ‘servant’, typically at Cambridge, although they don’t exist any more (the person who cleans your room is called a ‘bedder’.) College kitchens at Fen Polytechnic are still called GYPS, though.

A charade of CAP, A and CITY.
"
20571,Mind latter part of a sentence,OBJECT,"Definition: Mindlatter part of a sentence
A dd. The second element is referring to English sentence structure and grammar. English is a subject-verb-object (SVO) language, where the subject is usually the first element and is separated from the object by the verb. The meaning is dependent on that. *The man bites the dog* and *The dog bites the man* should put two different pictures in your head. Not all languages follow this pattern: in fact, SOV is more common among the world’s languages than SVO. But English is out there for the same word having different meanings depending on where the stress is, as here.
"

"
22912,Crime novelist who may provide illumination?,CHANDLER,"Definition: Crime novelistwho may provide illumination?
A dd. The first element is referencing Raymond CHANDLER, who created the PI Philip Marlowe; the second element is a historic word for a candlemaker, and is of course the reason it ended up joining – for example – Butcher and Baker as a surname. It comes from the old French word for ‘candle’, *une chandelle*, which has come into English in ‘chandelier’. Modern French has *une bougie* for a candle (and a spark plug).
"
22913,Allow the flesh to congeal’? Notoriously callous pronouncement,LET THEM EAT CAKE,"Definition: Notoriously callous pronouncement
A charade of LET, THE MEAT and CAKE. The usual translation into English of the French phrase *Qu’ils mangent de la brioche!* and attributed to Marie Antoinette as her response to being told that the peasants had no bread to eat.

22914, Patriotic icon loudly started to consume a wine served chilled,TUDOR ROSE,"Definition:  Patriotic icon
A homophone of CHEWED A followed by ROSE for ‘wine served chilled’. Not everyone pronounces the first consonants of TUDOR and CHEWED the same way; indeed, rhotic and non-rhotic speakers would have different ways of pronouncing the second syllable.  But lots of people do pronounce it this way, which is good enough for a homophone type clue to work.

The initial letters of the second to eighth words of the clue, and a cad.

"
22920,Spooner’s cooked food that’s on the breakfast table,TOAST RACK,"Definition: that’s on the breakfast table
I think it’s reasonable to say that Spoonerisms are not everyone’s favourite clue type, and for me at least this shows why. It’s how the legendary Reverend might have said ROAST TACK. One of the definitions of TACK is ‘food, generally’ according to Chambers but it’s hardly in common usage; and Roast Tack is not on the menu in the same way as Roast Beef or Roast Lamb is, so this solver wasn’t immediately guided to the solution. Whinge over.
"
22921, Came to like The Guardian,WOKE,"Definition:  Came tolike The Guardian

A charade of CROSS for what a winger might do and BAR. ‘All bar/save one of the runners finished the race.’ I don’t really get the extended definition here, despite being an aficionado of the beautiful game.

22936," Now, this sometimes supersedes his spoken word of reassurance",THEIR,"Definition:  Now, this sometimes supersedes his
Another dig at the 6ac, I fancy. A homophone (‘spoken’) of THERE, which – particularly when repeated – gives reassurance. ‘There, there, the puzzle wasn’t that hard after all, was it?’ The clue is referencing the fact that in these gender-fluid times, some persons choose to eschew the masculine possessive pronoun ‘his’ in favour of the more gender-neutral ‘their’. You even see these kind of preferences in the sign off of corporate emails, where the sender indicates how they wish to be addressed. Mebbes even folk at the *Guardian* do it.

A charade of CAR and a homophone of BIRETTA. If you are new to all this, then you might well comment that BIRETTA doesn’t sound exactly like BURETTOR in the solution. Try not to get too enraged: crosswords homophones work – reasonably enough – on ‘homophones in some accents’ or ‘near homophones’. That doesn’t stop some folk on these threads moaning loudly and at length, but ultimately fruitlessly, about such clues. Chill.
"
