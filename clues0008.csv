I think this is a great clue and a masterful anagram find but I must note one problem with it: ‘doctor’ can be a fine anagram indicator but I question how acceptable it is when, as here, it follows the anagram material. In my original posting of this blog, I referred to “I told you I was ill” as coming from a joke that Spike was known for. Being a great fan of the man, I now find myself ashamed that I had it wrong and that it was actually his own epitaph. Thank you very much to Eileen for setting me straight and giving us a link to an article about it (see comment #3 below)."

1626,Point of sale? (10),REDUCTIONS,"Point of sale? (10)
Cryptic definition. I presume the idea here is that shops put on what we call “sales” that involve price reductions. I have noticed that, in Spain and Portugal, sales are advertised using the word “reductions” in the local language meaning, I suspect, that they have no word that quite matches our “sale” in this sense. Surely the direct point of a sale is either to clear out merchandise that is not moving or to draw in customers; reductions are more of an indirect point"

I had much trouble with this clue — see my original attempt at explaining it in the next paragraph. Thank you, Bruce. Quadruple definition? I solved this using checked letters and assuming ‘shoes’ as the definition. It took me a while to realize that it is a multiple definition since I did not know there are trousers called pumps and, even now, I am not sure of how “Mike produces” works. My next thought was that it is a triple definition but my final suspicion is that it is a quadruple because ‘produces’ can well serve to define PUMPS by itself. I found that there is a brand of shoes called Mike Pumps but I hope that is not the reference; I am not against brand names being used in crosswords when they are well known but this one is, surely, not well known."

A[ffair] + (E[nnui] in TR[ouble]) in DULY (accordingly).

One could read ‘it’ as the definition. Or one could read the whole clue as the definition which would make it an &Lit. But the ‘ennui’ stuff hardly makes sense in a definition."

RARE (blue) + EARTH (planet). When I first solved this clue it seemed very clear that I had the right answer but I could not understand how ‘blue’ could clue RARE — and my Chambers could not help.

RE (touching) + VEAL (flesh). I do not recall seeing ‘touching’ used before to clue RE but a search of this site shows that such use has plenty of history. The connection is referring-to as in “touching on”. I have labeled “let slip show” as the definition although I am unsure that this is correct. It seems possible that Redshank intended “let slip” and “show” to be two distinct definitions although I find that strange since it seems to me that the inclusion of “show” muddies the surface reading rather than improving it."

Anagram (training) of MANUAL. We have a curious issue with this clue because the definition, “old girls”, appears to be plural while ALUMNA is singular and its plural, ALUMNAE, would not fit. My understanding is that the definition part of a clue should not be disguised syntactically. (Please correct me if I am wrong.) So the clue should have been, “Old girl’s training manual”, which reads just about as well. Then again, may it was just a typo!"

 For me, this clue raises a question about the use of ‘oddly’ in our crosswords. Some people would say that ‘evenly’ should be used here instead of ‘oddly’ to give the appropriate cryptic reading. So, does Redshank have any justification in using ‘oddly’? We take ‘oddly’ to mean pick the odd-numbered letters out of some word or phrase. And this seems very sensible although, as best I can determine, there is absolutely no dictionary-based justification for it. English dictionaries would countenance using ‘oddly’ only as an anagram indicator. Could ‘oddly’ mean pick off all *but* the odd-numbered letters? This seems a bit too, uh, odd. But could we accept letters in a word being numbered from zero rather than one? And, if so, would that make ‘0ddly’ work here? I am unsure. Then again maybe ‘oddly’ was just a mistake on Redshank’s part. Comments?"

RU (game, i.e. Rugby Union) backwards (over) in (during) SEIZE (the sixteenth French). This clue raises a question: ‘sixteenth French’ should really clue ‘seizième’ while ‘seize’ would be clued by ‘sixteen French’. There is one excuse I can see for having the clue the way it is, something that arises from the way the French number monarchs. We Brits would call Louis XVI “Louis the Sixteenth” but the French say “Louis Seize”. Does this justify the wordplay?"

Thus my alma mater, Glasgow University, has a Faculty of Arts, a Faculty of Science, a Faculty of Medicine, and so on.

Anagram (corrupt) of RICH OLGA I am assuming Mudd intends the entire clue to be taken as the definition here although I find it hard to understand it as one. Oligarchy is government by a select few individuals. An oligarch might well be corrupt, might well be rich, and might even be named Olga. But none of these things actually defines an oligarch. Is there something I am missing? Or maybe the question mark somehow makes it okay?
 P.S. Thanks to commenter Roz, I now suspect that Mudd is referring to rich and possibly corrupt Russians living in London. Which makes the clue much better — indeed maybe a brilliant &Lit."

Anagram (pants) of ARE WOVEN I gave a lot of thought to this clue because of its having OVEN, a key component of the answer, barely hidden in the wordplay. Or, perhaps I could even say, glaringly exposed in the wordplay. Strictly speaking I see nothing wrong with this at all — after all an ‘anagram’ is defined as something involving simply a rearrangement of letters; it carries no requirement of any particular kind or measure of disordering — but it is unusual. And I can see one potentially good reason for deliberately constructing a clue in this manner (other than for making it easier to solve). Which is misdirection. In the case at hand, ‘woven’ could easily be taken as an anagram indicator."
