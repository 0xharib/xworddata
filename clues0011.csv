Double defintition.
 
The Democrats (as well as most sane people around the world) certainly won’t want Trump to be around after November, and no-trump is a term in bridge.
 
I know nothing about bridge, so I copied this from the Internet – *In bridge, you have wild cards, too, called trump cards. However, in bridge, the trump cards are really wild because they change from hand to hand, depending on the bidding.*
 
*The bidding determines whether a hand will be played with trump cards or in a notrump contract (a hand that has no trump cards). If the final bid names a trump suit, that suit is the wild suit for the hand. For example, suppose that the final bid is 4♠ — this bid determines that spades are trump (or wild) for the entire hand.*"
