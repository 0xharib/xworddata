105,A soldier admitted to nearby bar without reason,ALOGICAL,A + GI (soldier) inside or ‘admitted to’ LOCAL (nearby bar) = without reason. This was a new word for us – it was easy from the cryptic part but we still checked it electronically after entry.

As reasonably competent mathematicians, we understand the origin of a graph to be the intersection of X=0 with Y=0 – the clue really doesn’t work, as it implies that any intersection could be the origin – i.e. the entire graph. However, graphs axes are labelled as X and Y so if you are a non-mathematician it probably wouldn’t even enter your mind!"

When writing up the blog we checked , only to find that one should never ask for the port to be passed. If someone doesn’t pass it on, you should ask instead, “Do you know the Bishop of Norwich?” We find the best way is to leave the bottle on the table and ask people to help themselves! Not very ‘Downton’!!"

502,Drink improved after pioneer’s investment,BEER,"We’re still baffled by this one. The answer must be BEER (drink) as it is referred to in 17D (as ‘ale’) – we think that the parsing must be that ‘beer’ would become ‘better’ (improved) by the ‘investment’ or insertion of ‘tt’, but we can’t see why ‘tt’ should be ‘pioneer’ – any thoughts out there??"

3059,Eastern school at first refused to present petition  to present petition,ENTREAT,"Definition: to present petition
~~This looks like an anagram of EASTERN without S (school at first ‘refused’) but where is the anagrind and where does the extra T come from? Or, is it E (eastern) + a word for school with the first letter missing?~~ ~~z~~EN (Eastern school) with first letter removed or ‘refused’ + TREAT (present). Looking at it again we were misdirected by thinking that ‘present’ was a verb! Thanks Gaufrid for the help!"

3069,Device putting jets into plunge? Stuff one copper must get into,JACUZZI,"Definition: Device putting jets into plunge?
JAZZ (stuff) + I (one) around CU (copper). Joyce, who is writing up the blog was unaware of the parsing of this clue until she wrote up the blog.

3093,11 marks 11’s fellowship,TEAM SPIRIT,"Definition: fellowship
TEA (drink – as in 11ac) + M (marks) + SPIRIT (drink – as in 11 ac). At first we thought that the first ’11’ must be ‘TEAM’, but then ‘marks’ would be redundant – given the multiple numbers in other clues, this clue could have been ’11 11 fellowship’ and would still work! However, not all teams have 11 players!"
3094,Earth removed from handle that’s not broken,WILD,"Definition: not broken
WI~~e~~LD (handle) with E (earth) removed. We have to admit that we ended up using a word search (WILD + E) for this one to discover the synonym for handle! Another theme word."

3110,They think there’s more to come than is actually the case,ANIMALCULISTS,A cryptic definition. This was one of those clues where if you had no idea of the answer the only hope was a word search using the crossing letters. You can guess which way we sorted out the answer. The search revealed that ANIMALCULISM is the theory that the spermatozoön (in this case COME) and not the ovum contains the whole of the embryo. We imagine there may be a few comments on this clue that have nothing to do with the theory!

3157,Plausibly Scaramanga’s favourite author?,AUSTEN,"Definition: author
As the gateway clue, this had us baffled until we had some of the thematic entries from the wordplay and crossing letters – the answer was clear, but the parsing had us stumped – the penny dropped after we’d finished the puzzle – Scaramanga was ‘The Man with the Golden Gun’ in the James Bond novels, so he would plausibly have a favourite AU (gold) STEN (gun)"

3206,12 as 14 or 12 as 10?,SIX OF ONE AND HALF A DOZEN OF THE OTHER,"Definition: 12 as 14
This ended up being a write-in from crossing letters, and then we puzzled over the parsing – it seems that the definition is ‘balanced (12ac) as situation’ (14dn) and the wordplay is ‘twelve as split (10ac)’.

Sounds like (‘heard’) MALE ORDER – (‘His master’s voice’)"
3515,What bean-counter might do to offer life assurance?,CHECK YOUR PULSE,"A rather unusual sort of clue – perhaps a cryptic definition? But there really isn’t a definition as such. No doubt YOUR PULSE would be CHECKed if you are being offered life assurance, and an insurance assessor might be described as a ’bean-counter’ (although the phrase usually refers to accountants) – the cryptic reference being that beans are a type of pulse.

We had a bit of a dilemma here with the the parsing of ‘HAR’ as ‘no end of bitter’- it feels as though it should be either HARsh with the last two letters omitted, or sHARp with both the first and last letters omitted – both words being good synonyms for ‘bitter’. There has been some discussion recently over wordplay requiring the omission of more than one letter, rather than the ‘customary’ single letter omission.

6106,Go before someone buys the farm (10),PREDECEASE,"Definition: Go before
~~We’re totally at a loss with this one – it must be PREDECEASE (go before), but as to the wordplay……. Our best guess is that it is a reference to the theme, where each animal ‘predeceases’ the next. ‘Buy’ can be a synonym for ‘swallow’ in the sense of ‘to fall for’, so perhaps Kairos is referring the the old lady ‘swallowing’ the entire farm – horse, cow, goat, dog, cat, bird, spider and fly – although it would be a very unusual farm with one of each! ~~ A little bird or should we say a barn owl, suggested we look in Chambers and there it was – ‘buy a farm’ meaning ‘to die’. Where that came from, heaven knows. In the end, there doesn’t seem to be any word play as such as the whole phrase means PRE-DECEASE. Well, you learn something everyday doing cryptic crosswords."
